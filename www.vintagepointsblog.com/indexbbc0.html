<p>Hello, friends! I am a day late, again, (sorry!) but my life has gone from 0-100 at an exponential rate, and I&#8217;m still trying to figure out how I can possibly accomplish all the things I need to finish on time. The recent California fires have finally died out, but my university is still struggling to organize the class schedules, and as a result, the new timetable for final exams is up in the air.</p>
<p>I spent Thanksgiving stressing about this, worrying about the GIANT pile of work (exams, papers, applications, presentations, etc.) that I have to do. But, that didn&#8217;t help at all. <strong>The problem is that I spent so much time worrying that I didn&#8217;t even get a chance to really do what needs to get done.</strong></p>
<p>I feel like having a stressful, busy, hectic life is over-glorified in modern society. If you&#8217;re clocking in 70 hours a week, working overtime on the daily, and constantly chugging an espresso or Red Bull, then there&#8217;s a sort of societal approval. People say, &#8220;oh, you have such a full life&#8221;, or they shake their heads and admiringly say, &#8220;I wish I could manage it all the way you do&#8221;.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&#8217;s kinda weird. Stress has been scientifically proven to wreck havoc on your mental and physical health, contributing to a shorter life span and a lower quality of life. And not only that, but constantly being stressed doesn&#8217;t actually make you more productive &#8211; as I saw this Thanksgiving break, it does quite the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>For me, my stress comes from my unrealistic expectations.</strong> Even though I know it&#8217;s bad, I want to be successful without having to put too much effort into my commitments. When I inevitably realize that I actually have to work after my dreams, it makes me scared that my labour won&#8217;t be enough, and I&#8217;ll never achieve my goals. This fear then leads me to procrastinate, and the vicious cycle continues.</p>
<p>The nice thing , though, is that once you recognize this flood of fear and anxiety, it&#8217;s pretty simple to end. Right now, I have a healthy and attainable work schedule, and I&#8217;m slowly but surely chugging along and checking things off my to-do list. It&#8217;s not easy, and I have to work really hard, but at the end of the semester, I know that I&#8217;ll be proud of myself.</p>
<p>If you are currently struggling to make it to the end of the year, just relax. <strong>Take a breath, drink some water, and do what needs to be done.</strong> Trust me, your future self will thank you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to completing everything on my to-do list and finishing the semester off with a bang. But, best of all, in a couple of weeks I&#8217;ll be able to take a guilt-free vacation. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Hello, loves, happy Monday! Whether you&#8217;re a high school student, full-time college attendee, or part of the work force, chances are that you will go through several interviews throughout your life. I&#8217;ve had to sit with scholarship panels, potential bosses, deans of universities, etc., and although I still get the jitters occasionally, I have curated some tips (see below) to help me do my best. Let me know if you guys use these suggestions, or have any of your own, and I wish you the best of luck!</p>
<h3>1. Dress appropriately</h3>
<p>The go-to style of clothing in America is business casual. This means a lot of different things for a lot of different people, but, essentially, <strong>don&#8217;t wear jeans, graphic shirts, work out gear, and anything dirty, smelly, or falling apart</strong>. If you live in a more conservative area, consider covering up any tattoos and removing any &#8216;unusual&#8217; (by Western standards) piercings. My favorite outfit is black trousers with an olive green blouse, and my hair neatly tied back.</p>
<h3>2. Speak with confidence</h3>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what to say, then <em>pause</em>. It is far better to think before you speak, versus using a lot of fillers words or accidentally being offensive. <strong>Speak clearly and concisely.</strong> Don&#8217;t be too nervous about &#8216;weird&#8217; questions designed to trip you up, because, chances are, they are more focused on your attitude and demeanor rather than your actual answer.</p>
<h3>3. Know your resume</h3>
<p>For goodness sakes, <strong>make sure you&#8217;ve read through your resume and you know what is on it</strong>. Be prepared to speak with authority on any leadership activities, promotions, etc. Also, triple-check for spelling errors before you send your papers out into the world &#8211; I had a dear friend not get a single job for three months, before he realized he&#8217;d spelled his university&#8217;s name incorrectly.</p>
<h3>4. Relax</h3>
<p>This interview, whether it is for a job, scholarship, leadership position, or anything else, is designed to see if some people think you are capable of the task they want you to achieve. <strong>It is <em>not</em> a measure of how important, successful, or &#8216;worthy&#8217; your life has been.</strong> You do <em>not</em> have to sit through an interview with people who are obviously misogynistic, racist, rude, etc. Just relax, because if you get this opportunity, then great! Congratulations! But if you don&#8217;t, then take it as a learning experience, pick yourself up, and go on to bigger and better things.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s face it &#8211; there are times when life sucks. You fall sick during finals week, or your cat dies, or you have a major falling out with a loved one. Some days, it&#8217;s easy to shrug off these crises and go on with your intended schedule. Other days, a feeling of unease covers your head, making everything feel just a little bit more terrible.</p>
<p>But, you know what? That&#8217;s life &#8211; in fact, that&#8217;s <em>your</em> life, and even if it&#8217;s been a bad day, it&#8217;s a day in your life that you&#8217;ll never get back. <strong>If you can&#8217;t enjoy a specific incident, then you can at least try to learn from it.</strong></p>
<p>Take, for instance, falling sick and not doing well on an important exam. Sure, you could cry and eat an entire pint of Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s&#8230;and in fact, go ahead. #nojudging</p>
<p>But, after you&#8217;re done moping and throwing your pity party, take a step back. <strong>What can you do to make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen again?</strong> What are the positives in this situation? How would your hero/ideal version of you react to this situation?</p>
<p>In the example of falling ill during an exam (something that has happened to me before), I learnt from that experience. Now, I make sure that I eat healthy foods, sleep 8+ hours, and avoid getting into fights with loved ones before an important event. On the plus side of that epic academic failure, I survived and still managed to get into a good university &#8211; something I was sure would never happen because I did so badly on that one test. Academics are important, but your health and well-being should always take priority.</p>
<p>This mentality of constantly learning can &#8211; and should &#8211; be applied to every aspect of your life. I say this as I, myself, work on incorporating this attitude into my personality. Whether it&#8217;s something with school, work, friends, family, or even your private thoughts, a problem doesn&#8217;t have to be a black stain, forever marking where you messed up and weren&#8217;t perfect. <strong>A problem is just an opportunity to learn, and grow, and become even more mature and experienced.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Good things should be celebrated, and bad things should be learnt from.</strong> That way no time in your wonderful life is wasted, and you can, hopefully, experience as much happiness as possible.</p>

<p>Hello, all! Midterms are right around the corner, and you know what that means&#8230;pulling all-nighters, eating ungodly amounts of ramen and chocolate, and, of course, deciding to give up on education and become a hobo.</p>
<p>College (and high school) kids are notorious for stressing about exams, and I am definitely guilty of this as well. It&#8217;s all well and good to say that GPA doesn&#8217;t matter&#8230;but it kinda does, especially in the 21st century where a bachelor&#8217;s degree is the new high school diploma.</p>
<p>Regardless, it&#8217;s important to take breaks whilst cramming your heart out, and these are my favorite ways to do so. Lemme know in the comments below how you relax during midterms!</p>
<h3>1. Work out.</h3>
<p>Yup, I&#8217;m one of those annoying brats who enjoy dripping sweat and aching muscles. Even a quick 30 minute session of dancing or crunches is enough to revitalize me, and the endorphin rush that exercise produces is always a plus. Also, you get to look hot even when you&#8217;re dying on the inside. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3>2. Go for a walk.</h3>
<p>Similar to Number 1, going for a walk helps maintain your overall fitness. However, I go for walks mainly for the fresh air &#8211; if you&#8217;ve ever been inside a campus library from October &#8211; November, then you&#8217;d have experienced the overwhelming stench of pure fear and anxiety that perforates the atmosphere. I try to go for a mile walk around the city, and (actually every day, regardless of testing schedules), I will walk to school.</p>
<h3>3. Hang out with friends&#8230;</h3>
<p>But with a time constraint. I like to promise myself an hour of socializing for every five I spend intensely studying &#8211; and once I get that hour, IÂ <em>reallyÂ </em>enjoy it. Whether it&#8217;s Netflix night or going out for Thai, it&#8217;s always good to give yourself a break, both physical and mental. You&#8217;re only young once!</p>
<h3>4. Indulge (a little).</h3>
<p>After a hard night of studying, I will literally fill up the tub, slap on a face mask, and blissfully sit in near-boiling water for half an hour. If I&#8217;m being perfectly honest, the last thing I want to think about during midterms is my complexion, and so I try to make sure I don&#8217;t stress-break-out. Just make sure that your version of indulging doesn&#8217;t leave you feeling worse than when you started (aka don&#8217;t eat two pints of ice cream in two hours).</p>
<h3>5. Study!</h3>
<p>The best way to de-stress during midterm season is to know that you know the content on the exam. I want to be able to walk confidently into a test room, without having to cram, and so I make sure that I&#8217;m taking steps to achieve that mental state. It might mean that I hide out in my room for the entire month, but by also engaging in Steps 1-4, I reach a pretty healthy balance between intense focusing, and productive chill time.</p>

<p>I know, I know, it&#8217;s a cardinal sin to wake up before 10am when you&#8217;re in college&#8230;and here I am, waking up at 6:30am and telling you to do the same. Oh, the horror, the savagery.</p>
<p>But, believe it or not, <strong>there are several reasons to wake up before the rest of your dorm building does</strong>. Let me know in the comments below if I&#8217;ve swayed your mind, and what time of day you like to wake up!</p>
<h3>1. More time to be productive</h3>
<p>In 2010, Christoph Randler, a Harvard biologist, discovered that early-risers are more likely to be productive. This correlates to a string of other studies that show people who wake up before 8am are more likely to get good grades, be healthier, and be happier.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about all that, but I do know that my roommates are dead to the world till at least noon, and that gives me plenty of time to catch up with school work/read a book/write a blog post (which I&#8217;m doing right now!)/etc.</p>
<h3>2. FOOD. ALL THE FOOD.</h3>
<p>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and the one that people are most likely to skip. However, there is something luxurious about having an hour to just sit back, cook yourself something you love, and eat a good meal before the day starts. My personal favorite breakfast is instant noodles with a poached egg, vegetables, tofu, and some chili flakes. Also, matcha lattes. Even if you don&#8217;t have time for this, something like cereal with berries will help jump start your morning.</p>
<h3>3. Quiet time</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t like labeling myself, but I suppose I&#8217;m what you would call an &#8216;introvert&#8217;. As I get used to being around people 24/7, the thing that helps me not go insane is waking up early. Why? Because it&#8217;s dead silent &#8211; I can finally think in peace. In the morning, I focus on my goals, my schedule, and my attitude. Making a conscious decision to be happy and grateful is really therapeutic, and making that decision all by myself, in the silence of the morning, is refreshing.</p>
<p>NOTE: Waking up early is all well and good, but to get your circadian rhythm in check you need to make sure you have at least eight hours of sleep a day. Sleep is <em>not</em> for the weak, it&#8217;s for everyone&#8230;!</p>

<p>Hey ya&#8217;ll, Happy Monday! Summer is the most wonderful time of the year, you know? Sunshine, cute clothes, gelato&#8230;and homework. Whether you are simply doing your summer required reading, or actual taking a course (ahem), chances are that if you are in high school or college, you have some form of work.</p>
<p>But!!!! It can be a breeze if you learn a few tricks &#8211; particularly note-taking. <strong>Taking notes in class is the single easiest way to figure out not only what&#8217;s important, but also what will be on an exam</strong>, and if you know what&#8217;s on the test, you can (hopefully) get a good grade and treat yourself to some ice cream afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Ice cream is always the end goal, you guys.</strong></p>
<p>So, anyways, here is how I take notes, during both lectures and active reading. Let me know in the comments below what system works best for you, and if this helps!</p>
<h3>1. Highlight. But sparingly.</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m loving the whole highlight trend right now, with the rainbow highlight and the reverse unicorn, but there is a definite line between having your glow on and looking like a disco ball with cheekbones. Similarly, make sure that when you take notes, you aren&#8217;t highlighting whole paragraphs &#8211; just stick to the basic, take home points.</p>
<p>Ex:Â <em>Wonder Woman</em> is a <strong>significant film in feminist history</strong>, not only for being the <strong>highest grossing movie produced by a female director</strong> ever, but also for the <strong>relationship of equals</strong> between Diana and Steve.</p>
<h3>2.Â Simplify. Simplify. Simplify.</h3>
<p>You do not need to write every word that exits your professor&#8217;s mouth. You do not need to copy out whole chapters from your textbooks. Bullet points and brief main ideas are golden, and are not only easier to write, but are also easier to memorize come dead week.</p>
<p>Ex:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid facing direct sunlight</li>
<li>add movement</li>
<li>rule of thirds</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Be able to read it.</h3>
<p>Legibility is a bit important if, you know, you actually want to put your notes to good use. A trick that my friend uses is to write messily during lectures, then copy them out #studyinspo style at home. Apparently, this also helps her with memorization and retention. I personally don&#8217;t do this, but I do make an effort to keep my handwriting neat and the doodles to the minimum.</p>
<p>Ex: We don&#8217;t need this &#8211; you guys know what to do. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>&#8220;Senioritis &#8211; a crippling disease that strikes high school seniors&#8230;the only known cure is a phenomenon known as Graduation&#8221;, as defined by Urban Dictionary. I thought that I was experiencing senioritis during the first three years of high school, when I slogged through an overload of acronyms (SAT, AP, ACT, STAR, etc), in order to get into college.</p>
<p>That wasÂ <em>nothingÂ </em>compared to what I feel right now, when I&#8217;m actually going to college this Friday, but I still have to study for my final finals (lol get it?). True, I only have to take my AP Chemistry final, since I was excused from the rest of them, but still. It&#8217;s the principle of the matter.</p>
<p><strong>The best cure I have found for senioritis is a hard dose of reality.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m moaning about how I&#8217;m spending my last days at home buried under textbooks, instead of with my friends and family, and yes, I know that burning out during the last few days of school is typical of kids every age.</p>
<p>But at least I get to finish my high school education. Just a few decades ago a high school education was as far as a female could get. At least I&#8217;m lucky enough to be headed to an amazing university. I&#8217;m fortunate that my parents are spoiling me rotten this last week, and even making me snacks while I work on flashcards and practice exams.</p>
<p><strong>Right now, all I can think about is the future</strong>. It&#8217;s just at the tips of my fingers, but there is a reason everyone and their grandmother says to enjoy the present. These are my last official days as a kid.</p>
<p>Yes, I can still eat M&amp;Ms on the couch with my family, as we watch a Disney movie, and, yes, I&#8217;m still a firm believer in naps. But after this week, things won&#8217;t quite be the same ever again. That&#8217;s not a bad thing, at all, but thinking about it makes me appreciate the moment.</p>
<p>Also helps me with the senioritis &#8211; speaking of, I should really be studying ionization and elements right now&#8230; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Essays are my strong suit &#8211;Â as many,Â <em>manyÂ </em>teachers have told me over the years, I make much more sense when I&#8217;m able to explain myself (in other words, I usually sound a little crazy). HavingÂ written nearly a thousand essays, and probably going to write ten thousand more, I&#8217;ve picked up a few tips &#8211; let me know in the comments below if this helps, and how you write an amazing essay!</p>
<h3>1. Figure out what your thesis is</h3>
<p>The thesis isÂ <em>the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span> important part </em>of anÂ essay. It&#8217;s literally the heart, with everything stemming from it. So, make sure your thesis is clear, concise, and explains what you&#8217;re going to discuss (without mansplaining). Oh, andÂ <em>don&#8217;tÂ </em>use phrases like &#8220;I believe&#8221; or &#8220;I think&#8221; &#8211; if you&#8217;re writing about something, clearly you believe/think it.</p>
<p><strong>Bad thesis:</strong> Fast fashion is bad for the planet.</p>
<p><strong>Good thesis:</strong> Fast fashion, or the quick succession of clothes from catwalk to mass consumption, strains our planet&#8217;s resources, overfills our landfills with nonrenewable fabrics, and contributes to child labor in third world countries.</p>
<h3>2. Center your body paragraphs around main ideas</h3>
<p>Most essays are five paragraphs long &#8211; one intro, three body, and one outro. So, make sure you have three solid ideas about your topic and thesis. Sometimes, however, this isn&#8217;t the case &#8211; but you can still use this tip. If you are writing a 20 paragraph long essay, you can either try to find eighteen main ideas, or have six home points that you drive in, with three paragraphs per idea.</p>
<p><strong>20 paragraph essay sample outline:</strong> MathÂ in criminal investigation ( <em>1 paragraph</em>), Estimating time of death (<em>which math is used + how to use it + real life example = 3 paragraphs</em>) Blood splatter trajectory (<em>see previous</em>) Unpixelating photos (s<em>ee previous</em>), Analyzing criminal activities (<em>see previous</em>), Confirming alibis (<em>see previous</em>), Figuring out tire tracks (<em>see previous</em>), Math in criminal investigation sum up (<em>1 paragraph</em>)</p>
<h3>3. Use quotes and outside resources</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re writing an essay, you&#8217;re probably learning something &#8211; so you&#8217;re probably learning from someone, or something. Use that!! It&#8217;s ok, and even encouraged, to quote people and studies.Â <strong>Make sure<em>,Â </em></strong>however, that you do<strong> NOT</strong> plagiarize, and that you haveÂ <strong>credible<em>Â </em></strong>sources. There was a girl above me who was expelled for plagiarizing her senior project, so please give credit where credit is due. Also, try to have at least one quote per body paragraph.</p>
<h3>4. Make it look nice</h3>
<p>OK, this sounds shallow, but makingÂ your essay looks professional makes people think you put a lot of effort into it, and that you&#8217;re proud of your work &#8211; which you are, right? Right? Anyways, if your teacher doesn&#8217;t have set guidelines for this, then just use Size-12 Times New Roman, double spaced, with an indent at the beginning of each paragraph. Make sure you proofread and use spell-check. Oh, and organize your bibliography properly!</p>
<p><strong>MLA format:</strong>Â Author.Â <em>Title</em>. Place published: Publisher, Year Published. Digital or Print</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Doe, John.Â <em>My Real Name</em>. USA: vintagepoints, 2017. Digital</p>
<h3>5. JUST DO IT.</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t procrastinate &#8211; you know what to do now, so just go!</p>

<p>I love science &#8211; it&#8217;s like being able to explainÂ the magic of the universe, andÂ you get to blow stuff up (a few of my favorite things). One thing I remember, from both AP Biology and AP Psychology, is the linkage between mental and physical health. People who are physically sick, are much more likely to have mental health problems, and visa versa. This makes sense &#8211; I&#8217;m not gonna feel joy and butterflies when my leg is broken, you know?</p>
<p>But, it can also be subtler than that.Â Not having regular eight hours of sleep makes you more likely to eat foods packed with sugar and salt, which makes itÂ harder to concentrate, and also makes you more likely to break out.Â When you can&#8217;t concentrate, you have to stay up late to finish the homework that only should have taken an hour to complete, and then you don&#8217;t have your eight hours yet again. It&#8217;s a vicious cycle, no?</p>
<p>So, here is my advice, for all those students/people in the workforce out there:</p>
<p>Check up on both your physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Make sure you are drinking enough water, getting enough sleep, eating enough protein, getting your vitamins, and have a regular fitness regime.</p>
<p>Make sure you are hanging out with people you look forward to seeing, you are taking classes/doing a job you love (or at least mostly love), and that you call your family once in a while.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the small things that make the biggest difference. Let me know how these tips work for you, and what you do to stay both mentally and physically fit!</p>
