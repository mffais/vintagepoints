<p>Hello friends, happy Monday! In between packing, work, and emails, I&#8217;ve managed to zip through yet another non-academic novel that I thoroughly enjoyed! </p>



<p><em>The Bride Test</em>, by Helen Hoang, dives into the world of Esme, a mixed Vietnamese country girl who is chosen by a mysterious woman to marry her American-Vietnamese son, Khai. Going to America to settle with a wealthy man would solve so many of Esme&#8217;s problems, including how she is going to give her young daughter a good life. The catch? Khai believes that, do to his autism, he is incapable of feeling love, and Esme only has one summer to convince him otherwise.</p>



<p>If you liked<em> The Rose Project</em> trilogy, you&#8217;ll love this book. It is very, very similar in the way that it approached autism, family relationships, and romance. With an added twist, the story has a mixed-race girl as the protagonist, and it&#8217;s actually set in Northern California, where I attended college! </p>



<p>The only qualm I had was that the ending felt a little rushed, particularly in regards to Esme&#8217;s academic journey, but overall this was an easy read that I think fondly of. In particular, I enjoyed that Helen Hoang is candid about her own mixed-race identity and autistic diagnosis, which I think adds a layer of depth to this novel and its characters.</p>



<p>4/5 stars</p>

<p>Hello friends, happy Tuesday! Sorry for the delay in this post &#8211; I just graduated, and between returning home, unpacking ALL my stuff, and spending time with my family, I haven&#8217;t had a moment to catch my breath!</p>



<p>Still, I did manage to finish one, non-academic book in the last week &#8211; <em>Wildcard</em>, the sequel and finale to Marie Lu&#8217;s <em>Warcross</em>. I LOVE Marie Lu&#8217;s last two series, <em>Legend</em> and <em>The Young Elites</em>, so I was very excited to pick up this latest work.</p>



<p>For some context, Warcross is set up in a world where everyone and everything is connected digitally through a game called&#8230;wait for it&#8230;Warcross. Emika Chen is a teenage bounty hunter who tracks players who bet on the game illegally, but one day, after an accident caught on live television, she gets a call from Hideo Tanaka, the young creator of Warcross. Hideo wants her to uncover a security problem in this year&#8217;s tournament, and so Emika is whisked off to Tokyo, where adventure and mayhem occur.</p>



<p><em>Warcross</em> left off with Hideo betraying Emika, and warping Warcross to control people&#8217;s morality. So, <em>Wildcard</em> begins with this setting, as Emika attempts to destroy Warcross and escape the assassins on her trail, all while still trying to make sense of how the man she loves could do something so horrific.</p>



<p>Personally, I found this series to be ok. Not as well written as <em>Legend</em>, and not as interesting as <em>The Young Elites</em>, but a solid, enjoyable read for the road trip that I was on. The plot is very, very similar to many anime and mange series, so if you enjoy East Asian-based adventure, romance, and science-fiction, then you will love this book.</p>



<p>4/5 stars</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, friends! Many apologies for my missing post last week &#8211; I was out of the country visiting family, and didn&#8217;t bring my laptop.

<p>Hello, friends! Many apologies for my missing post last week &#8211; I was out of the country visiting family, and didn&#8217;t bring my laptop. Anyways, while I was at the airport, I picked up a hardcover copy of <em>The Rosie Result</em> by Graeme Simsion. For those who don&#8217;t know, this is the third book in the Don Tillman trilogy, which began with <em>The Rosie Project</em> and <em>The Rosie Effect</em>. I personally have loved this series, and as soon as I spotted this book at the store, I knew I had to purchase it!</p>
<p>After 10 years in New York, Don and Rosie decide to move back to Melbourne, so that Rosie can pursue her dream job. Unfortunately, their eleven year old son, Hudson, is having trouble fitting in, Don is close to being fired after a disastrous presentation involving genetics and race, and Rosie&#8217;s supervisor is both sexist and condescending. Will Don be able to navigate this new phase of his life, including learning how to be a good parent?</p>
<p>I thought this was a brilliant ending to the trilogy, and thoroughly enjoyed both old and new characters. For those who don&#8217;t know, Don has autism (is autistic, has Asperger&#8217;s, whatever you want to call it), and so these books, although romantic comedies, are also unique in narration and difficulties that the characters must overcome. Things like learning how to properly greet someone and how to tone down passions are suddenly of vital importance, especially as Don tries to teach his son how to make friends and excel in school.</p>
<p>This book is very modern, mentioning <em>The Martian</em> (one of my favourite books actually), the present day debates over vaccinations, and, of course, the issues of whether an individual with autism should be made to &#8216;fit in&#8217;, or if society has a responsibility to accept them as they are. I enjoyed the tie-ins to both Don&#8217;s relationship to his father, as well as the lessons about forgiveness that both he and Hudson learn.</p>
<p>4.5/5 stars</p>

<p>Hello friends, Happy St. Patrick&#8217;s Day! My life has been..dare I say&#8230;very wholesome and chill for the last few days? I do have some work, but I&#8217;ve completed it, and my classes this semester are not too difficult, which means that I have a lot of time to do extracurricular activities and spend time with friends. Who knew that, at the age of 19, I would finally realize that I&#8217;m not an introvert, but an ambivert! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Anyways, I&#8217;ve also been making a BIG effort to have some screen-free time. It&#8217;s hard when so much communication and work relies on digital devices, but I&#8217;ve made a conscious decision to buy hard copy books again (no more Kindle!), and one of those books was <em>Persuasion</em> by Jane Austen.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: this is my second time reading this novel, and I have, for a very long time, labeled it as my &#8216;all-time favourite Jane Austen novel&#8217;.</p>
<p>But, tbh, what&#8217;s not to love? The story follows Anne Elliott, a 27-year-old who, after rejecting her love eight years ago following the advice of her father and friend, finds him back in her life. Frederick Wentworth&#8217;s only flaw was that he had no money and connections, and so he has hated Anne ever since. Could these two have a second chance at love?</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the writing style, plot, and character development of this novel.Â  Anne, who is not as overtly high-spirited as Elizabeth from <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, but still remains fiercely independent, has a special place in my heart. I also appreciate how she doesn&#8217;t apologize for her first decision to reject Frederick, because she had a duty to respect her father&#8217;s wishes and legitimate concerns &#8211; she doesn&#8217;t second-guess her decisions, and, considering when this was written, that&#8217;s a revolutionary characteristic indeed.</p>
<p>The nice thing about classics is that they&#8217;re usually pretty cheap. I bought my second-hand copy for five dollars at my local independent bookstore, and I know that I&#8217;ll treasure it for years to come. So, if you have some spare change, consider wandering around your neighborhood and picking up some oldies but goodies.</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading this adorable romance. 5/5 stars.</p>

<p>Hello friends, Happy President&#8217;s Day! I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;m planning on spending this three-day weekend relaxing and procrastinating with no guilt whatsoever. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love my busy schedule, and I&#8217;d probably go crazy if I had nothing to do everyday, but sometimes it&#8217;s nice to just get a break from the daily grind. One of my favourite activities on a lazy afternoon is watching films, and the fun is multiplied when that film is part of a franchise! Below are a few of my favourite movie series and trilogies &#8211; let me know in the comments below what films you enjoy, and have a great week, everyone!</p>
<h3>1. <em>Indiana Jones</em></h3>
<p>Ahahaha, of course this is top of my list! Any archaeologist who tells you that they weren&#8217;t influenced by the glamour and adventure of Dr. Jones is a bold-faced liar &#8211; whether or not he is actually an ethically-sound researcher is debatable, but Indiana Jones always manages to make saving-the-day even more exciting.</p>
<h3>2. <em>Jurassic Park</em></h3>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m in the minority, but I really enjoy the addition of Jurassic World to the <em>Jurassic Park</em> franchise. I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;ll ever continue from where they left off in 2018 (<em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em> ends with the whole world in chaos), but I always have a great time watching and re-watching these cult classics.</p>
<h3>3. <em>Harry Potter</em></h3>
<p>Speaking of cult classics, the nerds and geeks of the world would have my head if I didn&#8217;t include The Boy Who Lived in this list. Harry Potter&#8217;s escapadesÂ <em>literally</em> shaped my childhood, and I have many fond memories of waiting in line for both the books and movies to come out. Growing up, my favourite characters were Ron Weasley and Minerva McGonagall, but as an adult, I have a new appreciation for Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood. Who knew that standing up to your friends and being unapologetically yourself would be such good skills to have in university?</p>
<h3>4. <em>Mission Impossible</em></h3>
<p>Blame my mum for this one &#8211; if my dad introduced me to the joys of <em>Die Hard</em> during Christmas, then my mum planted the seeds for my love of this franchise. I love pretty much every movie, and I&#8217;ll always have a soft spot for Ethan Hunt&#8217;s wholesome heroism. Honestly, I really enjoy how Tom Cruise does so many of his own stunts on his own, and every time I exit the theater after watching an <em>MI</em> movie, I want to change my life course and become a super secret agent.</p>
<h3>5. <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em></h3>
<p>The only cartoon on this list, but definitely deserving of a spot. I absolutely LOVE dragons, and this is one of the few times I vastly prefer the films to the books (although the books are adorable and fun in their own right). I&#8217;m watching the final installment to this trilogy this weekend, and I&#8217;m beyond stoked &#8211; the plot, character development, soundtrack, and animation have all been on point for the last two movies, and I have high expectations for this next film.</p>

<p>Happy Monday, everyone, hope you&#8217;re having a fantastic start to 2019! I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time with family doing all the things we love, like escape rooms and visiting museums, but when I have down time, I&#8217;ve also been reading some books from my local library. Most of these are quick pleasures that I enjoy and then mostly forget about, but one novel has stuck with me. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">An Astronaut&#8217;s Guide to Life on Earth</span>, by Col. Chris Hadfield, describes Col. Hadfield&#8217;s journey from being a young boy in Canada watching Neil Armstrong go to the moon, to going to space three times himself. As someone who personally loves space travel (if only I met the height requirement of NASA!), I enjoyed Col. Hadfield&#8217;s frank, down-to-earth (ha-ha) advice on how to keep your calm in any situation, and how to remain determined, creative, and prepared throughout life.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three segments: <em>Pre-Launch</em>, <em>Liftoff</em>, and <em>Coming down to Earth</em>. Throughout the pages, Col. Hadfield discusses how he became a serious potential candidate for NASA&#8217;s space travel program, how he rose through the ranks, and how, after he retired, he remained content and proud of his life&#8217;s accomplishments.</p>
<p>It all comes down to a matter of perspective.</p>
<p>You see, astronauts in the media are seen as daredevils, people who are willing to strap themselves on a rocket and shoot off the planet willy-nilly. But this couldn&#8217;t be farther from the truth &#8211; astronauts enter space programs knowing that they might never get a chance to leave Earth, and they certainly don&#8217;t think that they&#8217;ll have to MacGyver their way into saving the day.</p>
<p>Yet, they continue to train, learn, and prepare with the same fervent ardor as if they were. Because when you&#8217;re prepared for every possible scenario, including the ones where you do or don&#8217;t go to space, you can reduce your own anxiety, and remain happy with your life, however it turns out.</p>
<p>This same mindset can, of course, be applied to anyone. When you base your entire self-worth on one thing, such as getting straight-As, or climbing Mount Everest, then you&#8217;ll only experience happiness when you accomplish that goal, and you won&#8217;t be content when you&#8217;re working towards or coming down from that situation. If, however, you accept that these things may or may not happen, while at the same time working to ensure that you do all you can to try and make them happen, then even the most arbitrary tasks will feel like fun.</p>
<p>There is much more sage advice and good humour tucked into this book, and I highly, highly recommend reading it.</p>
<p>5/5 stars</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><figure style="width: 248px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="https://immortalityawaits.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/hero-or-villain-01.jpg?w=452&#038;h=372&#038;crop=1&#038;resize=248%2C204" alt="Image result for villain hero" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><em>Every villain is a hero in his own mind.</em></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>When I was a kid, there were certain antagonists that I loved to hate. These were the characters that, although fighting against the hero, were charismatic and quick-witted. My friends and I would dress up as the Joker (we particularly loved Heath Ledger&#8217;s version), and Anakin Skywalker, because even though we knew they were villains, they were so muchÂ <em>fun</em> to pretend to be.</p>
<p>Then, you have the true villains, the most evil, vile, atrocious characters. These are the people who are unforgivable, such as Dolores Umbridge, Hannibal Lecter, and so on. Their cruelty and ruthlessness remain in our memories long after the pages are turned and the television is switched off.</p>
<p>The best villains and heroes are two sides of the same coin. Both must be intelligent, powerful, vividly described, and, above all, <em>determined</em>. After all, every plot has a struggle that must be overcome, whether it is stopping the destruction of the world, or, from another perspective, destroying the planet in order to create a new and better society.</p>
<p>But, then, what separates these characters from one another? What propels the antagonist towards the wrong side of a story? Although the most successful monsters are as brilliant and memorable as the champions, there are distinct differences.</p>
<p>I think the dissimilarity can be found in what they&#8217;re willing to sacrifice. A true villain will wantÂ to see their plan fulfilled, because they are convinced that they are right &#8211; BUT, they will never be willing to die for their cause. A villain will claim that the realization of an ideal is their priority, but loss of life is reserved for their victims.</p>
<p>A hero, however, is a person who will lay down their life for the good of others. A hero has an unshakeable, dogged resolve to save the day, and it is this absolute commitment that, ultimately, helps them defeat the bad guy.Â Heroes are heroes because they are the epitome of selflessness<strong>,</strong> willing to give up glory, fame, and their life in order to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Still, I gotta admit, I love a solid, three-dimensional villain &#8211; they are dramatic, cunning and completely fascinating. Within the realm of fantasy, the hero is only as good as the villain, and this Halloween, I&#8217;ll be enjoying both films and novels that star intriguing characters with an array of motivations.</p>

<p>Hello, loves, Happy Tuesday! I apologize for not posting yesterday &#8211; I got some really exciting news regarding what I&#8217;ll be doing this summer, and that, combined with midterm season, means that I&#8217;m a busy bee these days. However, although my schedule is packed, I&#8217;ll still be heading to the voting booths this fall (November 6, to be exact) to exercise my right to vote. Below are a few reasons why I believe I&#8217;m morally obligated to cast my ballot &#8211; let me know your opinions down below and, regardless of your political views, I hope you&#8217;ll get out and vote this year!</p>
<h3>1. People have fought and died for my right to vote</h3>
<p>The USA was<em> literally</em> founded on the idea that the people should have a say in how their government is run. Women suffragettes were jailed and tortured when they demanded to be treated as equals. Minority groups were beaten and murdered when they attempted to enter the voting booths. I have a duty to honor their sacrifice and ensure that future generations have the same opportunity to express their opinions.</p>
<h3>2. My voice needs to be heard</h3>
<p>As a young American who&#8217;s lived through everything from 9/11 to the Obama administration to Donald Trump, I&#8217;ve witnessed an unprecedented whirlwind of events. Right now, we are at a crossroads, and what happens in this election will end up in the history books. The issues that I care about, such as feminism, the environment, education, etc., need to be addressed, and by exercising my right to vote, I can express my beliefs within a democratic system.</p>
<h3>3. To change the world</h3>
<p>Plato once said that, â€œThe price of apathy towards public affairs is to be ruled by evil men&#8221;.Â  If I don&#8217;t vote, then I have zero right to complain about the outcome of elections, because I had the power to potentially change things, and I didn&#8217;t. Candidates would not spend millions of dollars on campaigns and advertisements if citizens&#8217; opinions didn&#8217;t matter. So, I vote to show my patriotism &#8211; because by voting for political leaders, I&#8217;m also deciding my country&#8217;s future.</p>

<p>Hello, loves, happy Monday! I just finished up a short road trip with my parents, and had the opportunity to watch the film, <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>, which I both loved and hated for reasons I&#8217;ll explain down below.</p>
<p>Since the first trailer came out in April 2018, I have been HYPED for this movie. I&#8217;m half Singaporean-Chinese, and not only is this film a romantic comedy (one of my favorite genres), but it showcases the country I consider my second home. I remember growing up and having my classmates tell me that Singapore isn&#8217;t a real place, because they couldn&#8217;t find it on a map, or telling me that my Singlish phrases sounded stupid. When I went into the movie theatre, I was excited to finally have proper Singaporean representation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not what happened. Hollywood first touted this film as the representation all Asians needed and deserved, citing the cast decisions, which is the first all-Asian cast in over 25 years. Then, after the movie started receiving criticism, they backtracked and instead said that this movie wasn&#8217;t meant to represent all Asians. <strong>That&#8217;s all well and good, but the premise of the story is about an Asian-American being plunged into the elite world of Singapore, and this film did a <em>horrible</em> job of representing Singaporeans.</strong></p>
<p>The accents were American and British, with hardly two lines of Singlish throughout the entire 120 minutes. Despite the fact that over a quarter of the actual national population is Malay, Indian, Sri Lankan, etc, the only time the movie showed brown-skinned people was as servants. Nick Young&#8217;s grandmother speaks Mandarin Chinese, even though in traditional Singaporean families the matriarch will speak Cantonese and Hokkien. Eleanor Young&#8217;s emerald ring should have probably been jade, if it really was passed down through the generations.</p>
<p>As usual, Hollywood jumped the gun.</p>
<p>This movie is wonderful in that it is the first all-Asian Hollywood cast in decades. I&#8217;m so happy that, finally, Asian men are being portrayed as sexy and masculine, and that Asian women are being given Cinderella-style happy endings. The showcasing of traditional Singaporean food, like pandan cake and klepon, made my stomach growl and my mouth water in the theatre. The days of Asia being portrayed as simply Chinese kung-fu, Japanese tea ceremonies, and Indian slums are hopefully over in American television.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this movie doesn&#8217;t accurately represent Singapore. <strong>To applaud this movie for <em>at least</em> not having a Caucasian actor play the protagonist (ahem, Scarlett Johansson and Emma Stone, I&#8217;m looking at you) is to accept a poorly-made hand-out. </strong>Hollywood can and should have done better. They should have done their research, they should have hired language coaches, and they shouldn&#8217;t have stretched their original promises to try and include &#8216;all Asians&#8217;. In the end, that is the exact same racist attitude that has been prevalent in our country for too long. The Asian identity is multi-faceted and too complex to ever be boiled down into one story &#8211; you cannot possibly make one film that explores all the heritages of Indians, Chinese, Koreans, Filipinos, Japanese, Malaysians, Indonesians, etc. etc.</p>
<p><em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> didn&#8217;t do a good job of truly representing Singapore, but, hopefully, the small but significant backlash will inspire Hollywood to stop making blanket statements about diversity, and to actually create a multitude of Asian-led movies. I look forward to the day Hollywood starts telling stories that are as unique and intricate as the people sitting in the audience.</p>

<p>Hello, everyone, happy summer&#8217;s day! For the past couple of years, I&#8217;ve been on a big non-fiction kick &#8211; documentaries, novels, podcasts,Â etc., are chock full of interesting facts., and now that I&#8217;m approaching my twenties, I think it&#8217;s important to expand my knowledge of the universe.</p>
<p>I recently finished the novel, <em>Lives in Ruins</em>, by Marilyn Johnson, and thoroughly enjoyed it for both the intrepid characters andÂ no-nonsense writing. The author explores the discipline of archaeology, interviewing and living with archaeologists from all over the world, who study everything from shipwrecks off the coast of America to how to save historically-significant ruins during wartime.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four main parts, titled &#8220;Boot Camp&#8221;, &#8220;The Classics&#8221;, &#8220;Archaeology and War&#8221;, and &#8220;Heritage&#8221;, all of which investigate not only the daily activities of several famous archaeologists (Joan Connelly! Laurie Rush!), but also <em>why</em> they do what they do. What could possess so many intelligent people to work in a field that is constantly underfunded and unappreciated? Why would anyone volunteer to spend their lives barely affording healthcare, plunging into war zones with military escorts and minimal phone reception, digging through the remains of African burial grounds, 9/11, and more?</p>
<p>The simple answer is passion, and, by the time you finish this novel, you&#8217;ll feel that spark of uncurbed enthusiasm as well.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;m a bit biased &#8211; for those who don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m an anthropology student, currently preparing to enter graduate school to study archaeology. So, for me, not only did this book excite (and slightly terrify) me at the thought of my future, but as an archaeologist-in-training, I loved catching glimpses of the stereotypes that are hilariously true, from our exasperated love of Indiana Jones to our preference for certain alcohols over others.</p>
<p>The realities of my chosen profession can be harsh and, at times, disheartening. You can&#8217;t save every artifact, you can&#8217;t fund every dig, and, sometimes, you can&#8217;t stop the parking lot from being built on top of sacred ground. Still, archaeologists continue to trudge forward, determined to preserve the history of our species, and to uncover the lost stories of the past.Â <strong>Archaeologists, at their core, are romantics, and Johnson&#8217;s honest portrayal of their passion stays with readers long after the final page is turned.</strong></p>
<p>In the end, I give this book 5/5 stars. Highly recommended.</p>
