<p>Ahh, it&#8217;s been a wild week, huh? Or maybe it hasn&#8217;t been for you &#8211; lol, it&#8217;s definitely been crazy for me, though! Last week, I survived my finals, I thought I failed an exam that I actually did well in, I was honest with a crush, I said (temporary) good-byes to my friends here in college, I had my last day at work and my volunteer organizations, and, of course, <em>I completed</em> <em>my undergraduate education.</em></p>



<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s been a weirdly impactful, yet still low-key last couple of days. I feel like this is<em> it</em> &#8211; the end. <strong>The end of what, though, is something that I&#8217;m still trying to figure out. </strong></p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the end of my childhood and naivety. The last two years have definitely forced me to acknowledge the messy, unintentional cruelty of others, as well as my own toxic habits. On a lighter note, I also am now used to buying my own food, booking my own doctor appointments, emailing landlords, etc. I&#8217;m a grown-up, even if I&#8217;m still a little scared of the adult world.</p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the end of my friendships. It&#8217;s a sad fact of life that a lot of friends drift apart when they aren&#8217;t in close vicinity, and, try as I might, it is inevitable that I&#8217;ll eventually lose some of the people I&#8217;m extremely attached to right now. That possibility hurts, and I&#8217;m already mourning the loss of my weekly in-person chats with my friends, and daily conversations with my co-workers.</p>



<p>And, I guess, I&#8217;m sad that something so good has ended. It&#8217;s like when you read a really good book, and you finally reach the last page. It&#8217;s what you wanted, and what you were working towards, but you still feel a loss when you close the cover. My college experience was incredible and complex and strange and happy, and I&#8217;m so, so proud of myself for being brave and going for every opportunity I could. </p>



<p>Now, I guess I have to take the lessons I learnt from the past, and apply them to my future endeavors. Wish me luck!</p>

<p>Hello friends, happy Monday! <strong>This is it</strong>, my last week of undergrad!! Well,<em> technically</em> I still have Dead Week (where there are no classes but we have to study) and Finals Week, but <strong>this is my last week of being taught new material in my courses.</strong></p>



<p>If you&#8217;re new here, then let me provide some quick backstory. Basically, I&#8217;m graduating two years early from my undergraduate university, and next fall I will start my masters program in maritime archaeology. </p>



<p>Okay, backstory done <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>But seriously, you guys, I can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re here. <strong>That we made it.</strong></p>



<p>Y&#8217;all know that I had a bit of a rough start last year, which really dampened my spirits. I got in with a bad group of friends, and I still have a lot of emotional scar tissue from that experience. </p>



<p>HOWEVER, things picked up, and right now, I&#8217;ve got many wonderful friends, dedicated professors, friendly work colleagues, and even decent grades (although my physics final might tank that&#8230;).</p>



<p>Endings are always bittersweet. <strong>What can you possibly say that can accurately summarize such an important time in your life?</strong> These people that I&#8217;ve met, these experiences that I&#8217;ve had, have all fundamentally changed me. I&#8217;m not the same person I was two years ago, and it is all because I made the choices that I did, and because certain people entered and left my life.</p>



<p><strong>Life is hard, but life is good. </strong>I&#8217;m so, so excited for my friendships here to continue once I&#8217;m gone, and I&#8217;m so, so excited to make new friends where I&#8217;m headed. Wish me luck. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Hello friends, happy Monday! I am recovering from an annoying cold right now, but today was a good day for me, filled with productivity and my self-created routine. My cold was brought about by stress and lack of self care, which is ironic considering how much I advocate for listening to your body and not pushing yourself too hard. It&#8217;s the last home stretch before I FINALLY graduate from my bachelor&#8217;s degree program, and I just want to be finished. It&#8217;s not that I haven&#8217;t enjoyed my university experience (I love the people I&#8217;ve met in the last two years, and I&#8217;ve definitely been academically stimulated) &#8211; it&#8217;s just that I have so many exciting plans and ideas for how I want to live my life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been told that I&#8217;m a big dreamer, and throughout my life, some people have made that sound like a bad thing. Stereotypically, I&#8217;ve had supposed &#8216;mentors&#8217; tell me to tone down my expectations, and say that I can&#8217;t do certain things because I&#8217;m a girl or because I&#8217;m mixed race. Conversely, I&#8217;ve had very wise people tell me that life is only so long, and my five-year-old self&#8217;s dream of being an astronaut, mermaid, AND president of the United States might be a <em>tad</em> bit unrealistic.</p>
<p>Right now, I&#8217;m a few weeks away from my 20th birthday, and I&#8217;ve spent more and more time contemplating my own mortality. It sounds morbid, but to be frank, death is the only constant, and I know that inevitably my life will come to an end, whether I&#8217;m 50 or 100 years old. <strong>I don&#8217;t want to die with regrets.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that I have to slow down right now &#8211; my health is being negatively affected by my high stress levels, and it&#8217;s a sign that I need to c h i l l. I also think that modern life carries a danger of overstimulation, with the constant multitasking and expectation of continuous productivity, combined with the overflow of social media into our personal and professional lives. I actually think that&#8217;s why the minimalist &#8216;trend&#8217; has exploded with such popularity. But, I digress.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still going to continue chasing every dream I possibly can. Some people take the comfortable path, and others choose the one less traveled. For me, though, I&#8217;m perfectly and wonderfully happy building my own road. <strong>I&#8217;m most comfortable doing the things that I want to do, and my life is spent creating my own adventures, which is exactly how I want to live.</strong></p>

<p>Hey everyone, happy Monday! Ahh, I can FEEL spring break kissing my toes, it&#8217;s only two more weeks till my university lets us out for ten days, and I honestly can&#8217;t wait. I love my life, but I&#8217;m so excited to have a break from school, work, volunteering, and all of my other daily activities. Sometimes absence makes the heart grow fonder, you know?</p>
<p>Anyways, as I cement my plans for the upcoming holiday, this summer, and next year when I go off to grad school, the more I realize the limitations of my wallet.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s odd, but I never realized that I&#8217;m considered &#8216;poor&#8217; until I entered university.</strong> Suddenly, I had my friends my age who literally own Gucci and Chanel, and who give $100 to the homeless like it&#8217;s nothing. One of my first roommates would regularly skip class to travel, spending her weekends in her family&#8217;s second home in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Me, on the other hand, I&#8217;ve struggled with money since I first received my acceptance letter. I&#8217;ve worked 1-3 jobs since the age of 17, I&#8217;ve had friendships deteriorate because I couldn&#8217;t afford to match their lifestyles (boba every day gets expensive quickly), and when the dining halls are closed, I regularly frequent the food pantry. I&#8217;m not poor enough to warrant living in a homeless shelter, and I&#8217;m lucky enough to occasionally afford luxuries like movie tickets and face masks, but my classmates and I lead very different lifestyles.</p>
<p>Still, I&#8217;m not unhappy. Yeah, I can&#8217;t satisfy every whim I dream up, but I&#8217;m supporting myself through college, without help from my parents, and I&#8217;m fortunate in that I&#8217;ll graduate with no debt. Because I&#8217;ve refrained from frivolous spending, I have enough money to fund the field school I&#8217;m attending this summer, and, fingers crossed, I&#8217;ll be able to start a 401k next year. My parents ensured that I learned about finances, and that education has helped me keep my head straight. Plus, as I continue on to my PhD, I&#8217;m going to be expanding my mind and learning new skills. As corny as it sounds, <strong>that intellectual depth is always going to be more important to me than buying new clothes</strong>.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that I&#8217;m a saint &#8211; in fact, this post was brought on by my guilt of buying some new (second-hand) books today. Sometimes I do buy things I don&#8217;t need, just because they&#8217;re beautiful and make me happy. But, for the most part, I&#8217;m good with what I have, and my wallet, even if it&#8217;s small, is able to support me. I work hard every day, and I&#8217;m continuing my education, so that I can take care of my family, and so that my own children will never have to go through what I&#8217;m going through. Destiny has forced me to become self-reliant, patient, and creative, and these character traits can only help in life. I&#8217;m a broke college student, but <strong>I&#8217;m poor right now so that, later on, I&#8217;ll have the knowledge and resources to help others.</strong></p>
<p>In the end, it&#8217;ll all be worth it, and we&#8217;ll celebrate our successes together <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Hello friends, Happy MLK Weekend! I am (finally) starting the spring semester tomorrow, and honestly, I&#8217;m excited to return to a stable routine. My winter break was packed full of events, activities, and seeing my loved ones, but it was also a vacation where I completely abandoned my previous good habits. This is my last semester as an undergraduate, and I am determined to build a morning routine that I can keep up for years to come. Below is my ideal morning routine that I&#8217;ll hopefully turn into a reality &#8211; let meknow in the comments below what your routine is like, and happy Monday!</p>
<h3>1. Wake up at 7am</h3>
<p>Last semester, my sleep schedule slowly but surely devolved, so that I was going to bed at 1am and waking up anywhere from 7am to 1pm. I laugh at myself two years ago, when I boasted on this blog about naturally waking up at 7:30am every day &#8211; in truth, I can only do that when I sleep alone, and so nowadays I use my phone&#8217;s alarm clock.</p>
<h3>2. Stretch</h3>
<p>I want to become a morning exercise person, but to be honest, I know that I&#8217;m more likely to go to the gym in the evening when my friends can accompany me. So, I simply stretch out for a good 10 minutes, and that&#8217;s enough to wake me up.</p>
<h3>3. Meditate</h3>
<p>This is a brand new habit I only started two days ago, but it&#8217;s oddly very satisfying. I say &#8216;oddly&#8217; because I used to HATE meditating, yoga, and all of those activities that require you to sit still and think about nothing. However, now that I live a life full of taxes, deadlines, bills, etc., (all the bells and whistles of adulthood, am I right?), I find meditation to be a soothing balm on my overwork brain. I only do 10 minutes, but those 10 minutes are enough.</p>
<h3>4. Brush my teeth</h3>
<p>Yes, finally, I brush my teeth.</p>
<h3>5. Drink Water &amp; Make Tea</h3>
<p>Stay hydrated, kids! My tea of choice is usually green tea, but if I&#8217;m feeling a bit under the weather I&#8217;ll go for ginger tea.</p>
<h3>6. Check my messages</h3>
<p>I know that all the life gurus say to avoid your email early in the morning, but my emails are a mix of both personal and professional, and I enjoy reading them. I also check for text messages, although I rarely have any this early in the morning.</p>
<h3>7. Read the news</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t go too in-depth with this, and I try to avoid news headlines that will make me upset or angry. Still, it&#8217;s important to be informed about the current affairs of the world, and so I like to spend a few minutes just scanning the articles of the day.</p>
<h3>8. Get dressed and ready for the day</h3>
<p>Finally, I get dressed, do my hair, put on a bit of mascara if I remember, and I prepare to walk out of the door.</p>
<h3>9. Write at 8am</h3>
<p>One of my New Year resolutions was to write more, and one of my life goals is to write a book. So, in the morning, when my brain is the most refreshed, I like to write as much as I can. This usually goes on for about an hour, although it depends based on how my creative juices are flowing.</p>
<h3>10. Eat breakfast at 9am</h3>
<p>Finally, I head down to the dining halls and grab some breakfast, before heading out for the day.</p>

<p>Hello, everyone, happy Voting Day! Hope my American friends went and made their voices heard today <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Going onwards into theÂ topic of today&#8217;s discussion, it&#8217;s astounding that more young people don&#8217;t know how to grocery shop. When you live on your own, you often have to take care of your own dietary needs, and getting Ubereats and take-out can get unhealthy and expensive very quickly. I helped a friend move into a new apartment this past weekend, and helped her set up her space &#8211; including getting her some groceries. Below are some must-haves items that I recommend everyone having within the first week of moving into a new home. Feel free to take what you like, leave what you don&#8217;t, and lemme know what you think in the comments below!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Salt</p>
<p>2. Pepper</p>
<p>3. Olive oil</p>
<p>4. Butter</p>
<p>5. Eggs</p>
<p>6. Rice</p>
<p>7. Frozen vegetables</p>
<p>8. Bread/Pasta</p>
<p>9. Some fresh vegetables and fruit (I always liked having tomatoes and strawberries)</p>
<p>10. Milk/Cheese</p>
<p>11. Some sort of snack (I&#8217;m a sucker for some good dark chocolate and fresh olives)</p>
<p>12. Canned soup (can be used as both soup and pasta sauce)</p>
<p>13. Beverages (coffee, tea bags, hot cocoa, etc.)</p>
<p>With these items, you can make pasta with vegetables, eggs on toast, omelettes, fried rice, sandwiches, chocolate strawberries, macaroni and cheese, soup, etc. As you get more settled into your kitchen, it&#8217;s nice to expand upon this list and grab things like fresh garlic, oats, flour, honey, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Happy shopping!</p>

Halloween is a couple of weeks away, but the bestÂ  costumes are the ones with thought and care put into them. There are all sorts of categories as well &#8211; you can be an animal, monster, hero, villain, or even things like memes and puns. I once knew a guy who simply glued a quarter to his back and became a &#8216;quarterback&#8217;, so, really, anything can be a good costume. Below are a few ideas that I&#8217;ll be considering for a TV-themed party that I&#8217;m attending &#8211; let me know what you plan on becoming this Halloween, and happy October, everyone!</p>
<h3>1. Lilo</h3>
<p>Did you hear that they&#8217;re making a live-action <em>Lilo and Stitch</em>? All you need for this character is a red and white Hawaiian dress (or oversized shirt, if you&#8217;re short like me), a plush Stitch, and you&#8217;ll be the cutest kid at the party.</p>
<h3>2. Eleven</h3>
<p><em>Stranger Things</em> is still having a moment, so put on a light pink dress, dark blue coat, and some white knee-high socks. Bonus points if you have a shaved head and some Eggo waffles.</p>
<h3>3. Edna Mode</h3>
<p>In honor of <em>Incredibles 2</em> coming out this summer, why not dress up as everyone&#8217;s favorite sassy-fashion-designer? Just plop on some oversized glasses, a short black wig, and something elegant but strange.</p>
<h3>4. Maeve</h3>
<p>I just started watching <em>Westworld</em>, and Maeve is already one of my favorite characters. Put on aÂ reddish-purple corset with a white blouse underneath, layered under a black velvet jacket, and add some black pants.</p>
<h3>5. Young Donna</h3>
<p>The main character in this <em>Mama Mia</em> sequel wears a lot of hippie, whimsical outfits, but my personal favorite is when she wears a flow-y orange blouse, some overalls, and a butterfly necklace. Just make sure you know some ABBA songs before going out to town!</p>

<p>Hello, hello, everyone! Just your friendly-neighborhood-blogger here, having some deep thoughts about university and academia. For the new kids on the block (continuing with the neighborhood theme), I am currently an undergraduate at a prestigious university, submitting applications to graduate school in the hopes of one day getting my PhD.</p>
<p>Basically, I LOVE learning. Things like 12-page research papers and 3-hour lab discussions excite me, because they are projects that broaden my mind and help me appreciate the nuances of the subject.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I called my best friend and was telling her about one of my lectures, explaining the ins and outs of magic, science, and religion (yes, it&#8217;s a very strange and very fun class). She interrupted me mid-way, and asked, &#8220;Can you please talk like a normal person? I don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re saying.&#8221; I hadn&#8217;t even realized the amount of scientific jargon and academic analysis I was pouring into my monologue &#8211; if the point of speaking is toÂ  communicate your thoughts and have the other person understand, then I was doing a pretty poor job of it.</p>
<p><strong>Who does academia serve?</strong> I mean this as a genuine/I-don&#8217;t-really-know-the-answer-myself sort of question. Do we do research in order to better humanity? Increase the stash in our bank of knowledge? Have fun with philosophical debates? When academics write articles and journals, <strong>are those articles supposed to be accessible to everyone, or to just a small portion of the population?</strong></p>
<p>Whenever I head into the libraries, I like to pick up random books and read them for a couple of hours. At my university, I often-times close the books after a few minutes. I do this, not because I&#8217;m stupid or lazy, but because these books are intended for a select audience that I am not a part of. These novels are for people who already have bachelor&#8217;s degrees, who already have conducted independent research and are used to the specialized language of their department. <em>They are not beginner-friendly in the slightest.</em></p>
<p>And, you know, in a way this makes perfect sense. Let&#8217;s be honest, how many non-academics would truly enjoy sifting through a 300-page paper on the sewer system of Classic Maya&#8217;s middle class? Or reading a 100,000 word report on dumpling production in 14th-century China?</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, what about papers and articles and journals that actually affect peoples lives? What about all those reports on poverty levels, nutrition, natural disaster prevention, etc.? Not only are these papers written in technobabble, but they are <em>literally</em> hard to find &#8211; you often need special access to library websites and good wifi in order to get them. Don&#8217;t the people featured and scrutinized in these reports have the right to comprehend them? To use the information found to better their own communities, without the condescending attitudes of outsiders? <strong>When we limit the audience we&#8217;re addressing, we&#8217;re also limiting the amount of people we can impact with this knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>The most important thing is to understand who you are trying to reach, and what you are trying to accomplish. The professors who write theoretical material intended only for other professors are rational and justified in their use of scientific jargon and obscure quotations. But for the academics who write in order to change the world, <strong>clear communication amongst the masses should always trump elitist views of intelligence.</strong></p>

<p>Hello, hello, everyone, and happy Monday! This past Saturday, I spent four hours inside a tiny cubicle, taking the Graduate Record Examinations. It was a stressful experience, and I&#8217;m so glad it&#8217;s over and I can review what I did right and what I wish I&#8217;d done to prepare for this important exam.</p>
<p>Firstly, the GRE is required for nearly every graduate program in the USA, and it&#8217;s also accepted in most schools in Europe, Singapore, and Australia. The exam consists of a Quantitative Reasoning portion (math), a Verbal Reasoning portion (vocabulary), and an Analytical Writing portion(Essays). The QR and VR portions each have two sections, and the AW section has two essays, writing a position on the given issue, and then analyzing a given argument. So, in total you&#8217;ll spend about four hours on the entire test. Here are some of my most relevant tips to ace this exam:</p>
<h3>1. Know exactly what will be on the test</h3>
<p>Look up all the possible essay topics, search for a list of GRE vocabulary words, and memorize the necessary math formulas. You will be doing yourself a huge favor in the long run, because you&#8217;ll be less stressed on the big day, and you&#8217;ll have a better chance of getting the score you want to get.</p>
<h3>2. Start studying at least four months in advance</h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t cram for the GRE. I&#8217;m serious, it&#8217;s incredibly difficult and most likely won&#8217;t help in the slightest. So, just put in 10-20 minutes every day for a couple of months beforehand, and study in increments.</p>
<h3>3. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR ID</h3>
<p>This can&#8217;t be a student ID &#8211; it has to be government issued, like a passport or drivers license. When I went in for my test, a girl was barred from entering because she didn&#8217;t have sufficient identification, so PLEASE DO NOT FORGET YOUR ID.</p>
<h3>4. Take care of your body</h3>
<p>Eat a healthy breakfast, sleep at least 8+ hours the night before, and try not to get the common cold. Your body has a symbiotic relationship with your mind, so treat yourself with kindness and take care of your health.</p>
<h3>5. Don&#8217;t stress too much!</h3>
<p>Your GRE score is important, yes, but it&#8217;s not the only thing that admission officers are going to look at when you apply to your dream program. Study, of course, but don&#8217;t focus too much on the numbers. Remember, not everyone has the drive and ambition to apply to graduate school &#8211; you&#8217;re already amazing, and, as cheesy as it sounds, your grades don&#8217;t define you! At the end of the day, school is there so that you can learn new things and explore your passions, and if you keep do that, you&#8217;ll ultimately succeed in life. I believe in you!</p>

<p>Most of my friends, for one reason or another, are international exchange students. They&#8217;re from Madagascar, China, Lithuania, and dozens of other amazing countries. Our dormitory is filled with diverse food, languages, and cultures every day of the week, and this is an incredible experience I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m able to have at university.</p>
<p>There are so many nationalities in our friend group, and sometimes uniting these wildly different people can be a challenge. So, one of the ways we solidify our friendship is by playing games &#8211; specifically, the game Mafia.</p>
<p>Mafia is a game that uses logic and reasoning, and is best played with a semi-large (8+) group. In other words, the perfect party game for highly intelligent international kids. Below is everything you need to know about Mafia &#8211; let me know if you play, and what you think!</p>
<p>Get a group of players together (we usually have around 12 people), and have everyone choose a card (we have professional cards, but you can simply write on bits of paper). <strong>There are several different types of cards:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> the person who tells the whole story, neither good nor bad</p>
<p><strong>Townsperson:</strong> &#8220;good&#8221;, usually 1-2 people have this basic townsperson card<br />
<strong>Doctor:</strong> a townsperson who can save only one person throughout the entire game<br />
<strong>Police:</strong> a townsperson who can point to someone they&#8217;re suspicious of and have the narrator confirm (with a thumbs up or thumbs down) whether or not that person is Mafia</p>
<p><strong>Mafia:</strong> &#8220;bad&#8221;, usually 1-2 people have this basic mafia card<br />
<strong>Axe:</strong> a mafia member who can &#8220;cut off&#8221; either a person&#8217;s hand or mouth, meaning for the next day (and only the next day, they regain control of hand or mouth the day after) they either can&#8217;t vote or can&#8217;t speak<br />
<strong>Bomb:</strong> a mafia member who, if they die, can choose one other person to die with them</p>
<p><strong>Alien:</strong> an alien is a fake townsperson who chooses a &#8220;proxy&#8221; &#8211; random person in the group, can be anyone. If the proxy is killed, the alien &#8220;activates&#8221; and become an evil alien who wants to be killed in the daytime. If the alien is killed in the daytime, the alien &#8220;implodes&#8221;, thereby killing everyone else and winning the game. If the activated alien is killed at night, nothing happens except for the death of the alien.</p>
<p><strong>Lovers:</strong> two random people in the group that the Narrator chooses, can both be mafia, can both be townspeople, can be one each. They try to save each other every day and win the game for themselves, but if one Lover dies the other one does as well.</p>
<h3>HOW TO PLAY:</h3>
<p>The Narrator sets the scene, describing the town and explaining the game. Then, the Narrator commands everyone to go to sleep &#8211; aka close their eyes. The Narrator then calls each character one by one.</p>
<p>Every night, the Mafia (about 3-5 people) vote to &#8220;kill&#8221; one person. The Axe also chooses a different person to either cut off the hand or the mouth. The Doctor can decide whether or not to save that person, but, remember, they can only save once throughout the whole game. The Police can wake up and point to one person, and the Narrator will tell them (using thumbs up or thumbs down) whether or not they&#8217;re Mafia.</p>
<p>Then, it&#8217;s the morning (aka everyone opens their eyes), and, depending on whether the doctor saved someone, someone is either dead or killed. So in the morning, everyone tries to figure out who among them is Mafia. By the end of morning (about five minutes), you vote who you suspect. Each person you suspect has one minute to say why you shouldn&#8217;t kill them/to point fingers at someone else/etc. Then everyone votes again whether or not to kill one person. You have to kill one person every day, and after you kill that person, the Narrator tells you whether or not that person was a Townsperson, Mafia, Alien, Bomb, or Lover (because Alien, Bomb, and Lover affect other people in the game, and Townsperson and Mafia are the key groups). Narrator does NOT tell you if someone is Doctor, Police, or Axe.</p>
<p><strong>The goal of the game is to have your &#8220;group&#8221; left standing,</strong> so either Townspeople/Doctor/Police, Mafia/Axe/Bomb, Alien, or Lovers. <strong>In order to win, you need to be cunning, intelligent, and good at strategy.</strong></p>
<p>May the odds be ever in your favor!</p>
