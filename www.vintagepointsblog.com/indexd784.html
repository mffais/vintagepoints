<p>Hello friends, Happy Monday! This will be my last post for a few weeks &#8211; for those who don&#8217;t know, I will be traveling to join an archaeological excavation, and will have limited/no access to wifi.</p>



<p>I finally finished packing for my trip yesterday, and today I&#8217;ve been packing for my eventual move to grad school. My goodness, I have a lot of stuff! Books lining my shelves, tucked underneath my lamp, balanced on chairs, and even hidden inside my closet. Memorabilia from movies, plays, musicals, and museums. Thank you notes from when I used to volunteer with little kids. Birthday cards, homework, half-used diaries &#8211; honestly, I always considered myself a minimalist, but this cleanse was a healthy dose of reality.</p>



<p>My upcoming trip isn&#8217;t my first time out of the country by myself, but it does sort of mark my &#8216;true&#8217; passage to adulthood, if that makes sense. I applied and got accepted to this program by myself, I paid for it by myself, and I didn&#8217;t ask permission to go. It&#8217;s weird, going through my old things from just a few years ago and seeing how far I&#8217;ve come. Sixteen-year-old me was still stressing about AP Exams and if I would ever fall in love, and now, 20-year-old me is preparing to pay bills and travel the world.</p>



<p>When I was young, all I could think about was the future. I was SO EXCITED to finally start &#8216;living my life&#8217;. But, looking back, I <strong>was</strong> living &#8211; having fun with friends, being a part of my community, and preparing myself for a life of academics. Now, I&#8217;m just enjoying the present &#8211; I&#8217;m not particularly worried about this trip, and I&#8217;m not stressed about making a good impression or being the class favourite. Whatever happens will happen, and my goal is simply to make the best of every day I can. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ll see you guys in four weeks! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Hello, friends, happy Monday! I&#8217;ve been having a busy last few days, filled with hanging out with family, friends, and strangers. At one point last week, I had someone comment on my life, which, if you go by the highlights, has been extremely exciting and, as she put it, &#8220;like an adventure novel&#8221;. </p>



<p>To be honest, I was both flattered and bemused. I have always wanted to live a life of interest, filled with travels, hilarious escapades, and good friends. And now, in a lot of ways, I am fulfilling that dream, and I&#8217;m grateful.</p>



<p>Still, this wasn&#8217;t entirely the work of destiny. I made specific, life-altering decisions (such as studying abroad and going to grad school), and I continue to make daily choices (to work out, to text my long-distance friends, to study languages, etc.) that help shape my life into the way I want it to be.</p>



<p>Life is simultaneously long and short. I am a firm believer that a person can have it &#8216;all&#8217;, but not necessarily all at the same time. Now that I&#8217;m in my twenties, my priority for the next decade is to further my education, travel as much as possible, and be &#8216;selfish&#8217;, in a way, with how I spend my time. Of course there are practical concerns, such as money and family responsibilities and taxes and so on, but at the end of the day, you are in control of your life. I hope you live an adventure you&#8217;re proud of, and, if not, I hope you have the courage to start where you are now, and do what you can to chase your happiness.</p>

<p>Hello friends, happy Monday! In between packing, work, and emails, I&#8217;ve managed to zip through yet another non-academic novel that I thoroughly enjoyed! </p>



<p><em>The Bride Test</em>, by Helen Hoang, dives into the world of Esme, a mixed Vietnamese country girl who is chosen by a mysterious woman to marry her American-Vietnamese son, Khai. Going to America to settle with a wealthy man would solve so many of Esme&#8217;s problems, including how she is going to give her young daughter a good life. The catch? Khai believes that, do to his autism, he is incapable of feeling love, and Esme only has one summer to convince him otherwise.</p>



<p>If you liked<em> The Rose Project</em> trilogy, you&#8217;ll love this book. It is very, very similar in the way that it approached autism, family relationships, and romance. With an added twist, the story has a mixed-race girl as the protagonist, and it&#8217;s actually set in Northern California, where I attended college! </p>



<p>The only qualm I had was that the ending felt a little rushed, particularly in regards to Esme&#8217;s academic journey, but overall this was an easy read that I think fondly of. In particular, I enjoyed that Helen Hoang is candid about her own mixed-race identity and autistic diagnosis, which I think adds a layer of depth to this novel and its characters.</p>



<p>4/5 stars</p>

<p>Hello friends, happy Tuesday! Sorry for the delay in this post &#8211; I just graduated, and between returning home, unpacking ALL my stuff, and spending time with my family, I haven&#8217;t had a moment to catch my breath!</p>



<p>Still, I did manage to finish one, non-academic book in the last week &#8211; <em>Wildcard</em>, the sequel and finale to Marie Lu&#8217;s <em>Warcross</em>. I LOVE Marie Lu&#8217;s last two series, <em>Legend</em> and <em>The Young Elites</em>, so I was very excited to pick up this latest work.</p>



<p>For some context, Warcross is set up in a world where everyone and everything is connected digitally through a game called&#8230;wait for it&#8230;Warcross. Emika Chen is a teenage bounty hunter who tracks players who bet on the game illegally, but one day, after an accident caught on live television, she gets a call from Hideo Tanaka, the young creator of Warcross. Hideo wants her to uncover a security problem in this year&#8217;s tournament, and so Emika is whisked off to Tokyo, where adventure and mayhem occur.</p>



<p><em>Warcross</em> left off with Hideo betraying Emika, and warping Warcross to control people&#8217;s morality. So, <em>Wildcard</em> begins with this setting, as Emika attempts to destroy Warcross and escape the assassins on her trail, all while still trying to make sense of how the man she loves could do something so horrific.</p>



<p>Personally, I found this series to be ok. Not as well written as <em>Legend</em>, and not as interesting as <em>The Young Elites</em>, but a solid, enjoyable read for the road trip that I was on. The plot is very, very similar to many anime and mange series, so if you enjoy East Asian-based adventure, romance, and science-fiction, then you will love this book.</p>



<p>4/5 stars</p>

<p>Ahh, it&#8217;s been a wild week, huh? Or maybe it hasn&#8217;t been for you &#8211; lol, it&#8217;s definitely been crazy for me, though! Last week, I survived my finals, I thought I failed an exam that I actually did well in, I was honest with a crush, I said (temporary) good-byes to my friends here in college, I had my last day at work and my volunteer organizations, and, of course, <em>I completed</em> <em>my undergraduate education.</em></p>



<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s been a weirdly impactful, yet still low-key last couple of days. I feel like this is<em> it</em> &#8211; the end. <strong>The end of what, though, is something that I&#8217;m still trying to figure out. </strong></p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the end of my childhood and naivety. The last two years have definitely forced me to acknowledge the messy, unintentional cruelty of others, as well as my own toxic habits. On a lighter note, I also am now used to buying my own food, booking my own doctor appointments, emailing landlords, etc. I&#8217;m a grown-up, even if I&#8217;m still a little scared of the adult world.</p>



<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the end of my friendships. It&#8217;s a sad fact of life that a lot of friends drift apart when they aren&#8217;t in close vicinity, and, try as I might, it is inevitable that I&#8217;ll eventually lose some of the people I&#8217;m extremely attached to right now. That possibility hurts, and I&#8217;m already mourning the loss of my weekly in-person chats with my friends, and daily conversations with my co-workers.</p>



<p>And, I guess, I&#8217;m sad that something so good has ended. It&#8217;s like when you read a really good book, and you finally reach the last page. It&#8217;s what you wanted, and what you were working towards, but you still feel a loss when you close the cover. My college experience was incredible and complex and strange and happy, and I&#8217;m so, so proud of myself for being brave and going for every opportunity I could. </p>



<p>Now, I guess I have to take the lessons I learnt from the past, and apply them to my future endeavors. Wish me luck!</p>

<p>Hello friends, happy Sunday! I have my last undergrad final EVER this Tuesday, and then next Tuesday I graduate!! Also, I just turned 20 a few days ago. SO, it makes sense that I&#8217;ve been feeling very nostalgic lately, and, in particular, I&#8217;ve been really thinking about how I&#8217;ve changed as a human being.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s so strange, trying to balance self-love with honest self-discipline. I love myself, but I am fundamentally imperfect, and it&#8217;s a good thing to want to work on that. </p>



<p>Growing up, I was a crazy, cheerful kid who cut my dresses with scissors and made friends with the school custodians. When I entered middle and high school, I got a bit more subdued, as I learned that people aren&#8217;t always kind, and I also went through my brief teenage rebellion (lol). In my first semester of college, I went through both romantic and platonic heartbreak, and it took me another entire semester to recover from that sadness.</p>



<p>So, this past year has been my chance to really LIVE for myself, without having to be dependent on my family or deal with emotional drama. This has also been my chance to really go crazy exploring the different facets of my personality, and figure out who I am when I&#8217;m surrounded by my peers who don&#8217;t know my past.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve changed so much. Some things might seem arbitrary, like how I now enjoy wearing jewelry and drinking iced mochas, while others are more obvious, such as my growing circle of friends and diminishing social anxiety. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s ok to change. It&#8217;s ok to redefine yourself, over and over again, as you grow up and gain new experiences. Sometimes I get scared that I&#8217;m &#8216;losing&#8217; myself to adulthood and social norms, but that fear is illogical. I am always going to be me, and if something makes me happy, it doesn&#8217;t matter if that thing is popular or a fringe interest.</p>



<p>My pursuit of happiness has remained the same, even as what makes me happy has evolved, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s most important. </p>



<p>I wonder what the next years of my life will bring? I&#8217;m excited to find out <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Hello friends, happy Saturday! I&#8217;m uploading this blog post a little early, because this upcoming week I will be celebrating my birthday, writing my final essays, and also preparing for graduation. Last year, I made a post about 19 things I learned at 19, but now that I&#8217;m older and wiser (hehe) I think that I&#8217;ll share the skills I&#8217;m grateful to have right now. Thank you for all of your support, everyone, and have a wonderful week!</p>



<p>1. How to grocery shop</p>



<p>This took a bit a trial and error, but I learned how to actually grocery shop over the last few years, and it is a very useful skill, especially when your roommate buys six jars of Nutella and one bag of shredded cheese for the week&#8217;s meals&#8230;</p>



<p>2. How to be disciplined </p>



<p>You can&#8217;t just slap on a face mask and call it a day. You have to put on the face mask, knowing that you are taking time to relax, so that your productivity won&#8217;t be impacted by your stress levels. Procrastination is just fear of criticism and imperfection, so nix it asap and make time in your life for work and pleasure equally.</p>



<p>3. How to make friends</p>



<p>Friends are so, so important, I cannot stress this enough!!!! I used to label myself as an introvert, but in reality I&#8217;m an ambivert who was hanging out with the wrong group of people. Actively work to find your tribe, and show them you love them.</p>



<p>4. How to live with few regrets</p>



<p>“However, never underestimate the power of privately extending a simple, loving, but direct challenge. Though it may not be reciprocated, such love is never wasted.” &#8211; Elder Neal A. Maxwell. The common internet paraphrasing is &#8220;Love is never wasted, for its value does not rest on reciprocity&#8221;. Either way, very true!!</p>



<p>5. How to write a good thank you note</p>



<p>After interviews, when someone writes you a letter of recommendation, when your friend buys you a gift&#8230;I personally think that the art of handwritten thank you notes is very unappreciated in the modern world, and that should be remedied asap.</p>



<p>6. How to shop</p>



<p>It took me so long to admit I wear things that are too big because I&#8217;m uncomfortable with my body. However, not only was this a waste of money, but it was unflattering and further destroyed my confidence. IGNORE the label, and focus on how the actually fabric fits you. I&#8217;ve been everything from an XS to XL in the last few months, so just throw that all out of the window and look at your measurements.</p>



<p>7. How to play the piano</p>



<p>I think everyone should learn how to play at least one instrument, and even though I really hated being forced to learn when I was a kid, I&#8217;m grateful that I have a creative outlet that involves music.</p>



<p>8. How to accept a compliment</p>



<p>This is a bit harsh, but I&#8217;ll be honest &#8211; when I give someone a compliment and they turn it into an insult on themselves, it annoys me. I&#8217;m known as a person with good taste, so if I compliment your intellect or fashion sense, and you tell me I&#8217;m crazy, then we&#8217;re both in an awkward situation.</p>



<p>9. How to file taxes</p>



<p>I&#8217;m so, so grateful I forced myself to learn this early on my life, instead of paying someone half of my paycheck every year to do it for me.</p>



<p>10. How to forgive</p>



<p>Oof &#8211; sometimes people are cruel and ignorant. But, as an old Tumblr post once said, &#8220;The fire that warms your heart now will leave you cold in the grave&#8221;. Fight for justice, of course, but don&#8217;t let your mind be consumed with anger and resentment.</p>



<p>11. How to cook</p>



<p>Another!! Very!! Important!! Skill!! Please don&#8217;t be that twenty-something spending $100 a week on food because you don&#8217;t know how to boil an egg.</p>



<p>12. How to change a lightbulb</p>



<p>Another very useful and underrated skill!</p>



<p>13. How to tip</p>



<p>I always tip 20%~ by moving the decimal place and then multiplying the new number by 2. For example, if I have a bill of $16.43, I multiple $1.64 by 2 and then tip $3.24. Saves a lot of time!</p>



<p>14. How to use Microsoft, Excel, and Photoshop</p>



<p>I will enroll my children in computer coding classes, but until then, I&#8217;m glad I know how to use Microsoft, Excel, Photoshop, and I have basic video editing skills. The modern-day job market requires so much internet savvy, so do yourself a favor and learn early on.</p>



<p>15. How to apologize</p>



<p>It&#8217;s always hard to apologize, but it&#8217;s invaluable to your self growth, the person you are apologizing to, and also your relationship. I&#8217;ve screwed up countless times, but a heartfelt apology goes a long way, and my relationships have been made stronger by it.</p>



<p>16. How to cut a mango</p>



<p>I&#8217;m really good at this, lol.</p>



<p>17. How to study</p>



<p>Everyone learns differently, and I&#8217;ve realized that I study best when I&#8217;m alone in a cafe or similar environment with minimal noise and relaxed food policies. I&#8217;m also a hardcore handwritten-notes advocate. So, find out what works for you, and ACTUALLY do that.</p>



<p>18. How to take risks</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a difference between being stupid and taking a calculated risk. If you weigh the pros and cons, and the benefits are great, then stop thinking and go for it. Don&#8217;t, however, be reckless with your life and the lives of others.</p>



<p>19. How to draw quickly</p>



<p>The amount of times I&#8217;ve placated a small child with a drawing is immeasurable. Learn how to draw some basic animals, people, and rockets and you&#8217;ll be good. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>20. How to be grateful</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve loved my 19th year of life &#8211; I made so many new, genuine friends, and I&#8217;m so happy with what I&#8217;ve accomplished and what the future has in store for me. Shout-out to the universe for gifting me with this life, and here&#8217;s to hoping that 20 has even better adventures in store <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Hello friends, happy Monday! <strong>This is it</strong>, my last week of undergrad!! Well,<em> technically</em> I still have Dead Week (where there are no classes but we have to study) and Finals Week, but <strong>this is my last week of being taught new material in my courses.</strong></p>



<p>If you&#8217;re new here, then let me provide some quick backstory. Basically, I&#8217;m graduating two years early from my undergraduate university, and next fall I will start my masters program in maritime archaeology. </p>



<p>Okay, backstory done <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>But seriously, you guys, I can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re here. <strong>That we made it.</strong></p>



<p>Y&#8217;all know that I had a bit of a rough start last year, which really dampened my spirits. I got in with a bad group of friends, and I still have a lot of emotional scar tissue from that experience. </p>



<p>HOWEVER, things picked up, and right now, I&#8217;ve got many wonderful friends, dedicated professors, friendly work colleagues, and even decent grades (although my physics final might tank that&#8230;).</p>



<p>Endings are always bittersweet. <strong>What can you possibly say that can accurately summarize such an important time in your life?</strong> These people that I&#8217;ve met, these experiences that I&#8217;ve had, have all fundamentally changed me. I&#8217;m not the same person I was two years ago, and it is all because I made the choices that I did, and because certain people entered and left my life.</p>



<p><strong>Life is hard, but life is good. </strong>I&#8217;m so, so excited for my friendships here to continue once I&#8217;m gone, and I&#8217;m so, so excited to make new friends where I&#8217;m headed. Wish me luck. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Hello friends, happy Sunday! And, for those of you who are Christian, happy Easter!</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a bit sad right now &#8211; I woke up to the news of bombings in Sri Lankan churches, with hundreds of people dying and in pain. This is right after the news of the fire at Notre Dame, which, although the result of an accident, has still had a horrible effect on Easter celebrations.</p>



<p>A few hours after Notre Dame, my social media already began filling with people who were laughing about what had happened, saying it was &#8216;fate&#8217; for what Christian crusaders have done throughout the centuries, calling out the millionaires who were willing to pledge money to rebuild the church but not to help the homeless, and so on.</p>



<p>TBH, I find this a bit ironic. In the novel, <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>, by Victor Hugo, there is a LOT of social commentary about elitism, morality, compassion, etc. But, at the same time, Victor Hugo wrote the book because he wanted to SAVE Notre Dame from demolition &#8211; he thought it was an important symbol of Christianity, and an overall beautiful, historic building.</p>



<p>Now, people have used Christianity to excuse a LOT of truly evil, heinous acts. That is a fact. But, at the same time, you can twist ANY religious or spiritual belief into something that it&#8217;s not &#8211; just look at the recent bombing in Sri Lankan, which was carried out by Muslim terrorists. Islam is not an evil religion, but sometimes people who proclaim to be Muslim commit atrocities. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not right to make fun of people&#8217;s suffering. Those who immediately ridiculed Notre Dame&#8217;s destruction should be ashamed of themselves, and those who chose to murder people in their place of worship, on a day of celebration, must answer for their crimes.</p>



<p>Sometimes, I wonder if religion is worth all of this pain. I live in a very liberal city, where my friends say that they aren&#8217;t religious because they don&#8217;t think religion is a good thing. A lot of people echo these sentiments.</p>



<p>However, I would disagree. My religion has shaped my moral compass, and has taught me right from wrong. It comforts me in times of distress. My religion has taught me that justice is worth fighting for, and forgiveness is the only way to let go of the past. I&#8217;m not trying to be a good person so that I can enjoy the afterlife &#8211; I&#8217;m trying to be a good person because I think that our sincere connections with others are the most important thing on Earth. </p>



<p>In this modern world, compassion is more important than ever. Regardless of your spiritual/religious beliefs, I hope we can treat each other gently, so that we can live together in peace. </p>

<p>Hello friends, happy Sunday! I&#8217;m writing this post a day early, because I have a busy week ahead, but I still want to keep in touch with y&#8217;all <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Yesterday, I had a really good day. I got to spend time with someone I love (I suppose you could call her a &#8216;best friend&#8217;, but she&#8217;s more than that, because I know I&#8217;ll love her forever) and we had a lot of fun eating, catching up, and exercising.</p>
</div></div>



<p>In the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve really been thinking about how I want my next two years in grad school to look like. I don&#8217;t want to keep ignoring my health in the way I have during undergrad. I don&#8217;t want to keep denying myself the small pleasures of life, like fresh flowers or cute jewelry, just for the sake of &#8216;being practical&#8217;. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and you are responsible for your own happiness.</p>



<p>SO, this fall, I&#8217;m going to start becoming really serious about working out. I do work out now, but I don&#8217;t have easy access to healthy food, so I only have to energy to do cardio. This fall, I want to start growing my muscles and building my strength. </p>



<p>I also think that I&#8217;m going to invest in a Vitamix. I&#8217;ve wanted one for a looonnnggg time, and I&#8217;m excited to make smoothies, hummus, pesto, etc., from scratch. I&#8217;m planning on cooking most of my meals at home, but one of my big loves in life is food, and I don&#8217;t want to sacrifice that.</p>



<p>Finally, I want to invest in myself. Things like seriously studying French (I&#8217;m hoping to take a proficiency exam in two years), finding my own sense of style, decorating my new apartment, etc., are goals that will take a bit of money and a lot of time, but I will reap the benefits, and it will make me happy.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m thinking for the future, and I know that I&#8217;m rambling, but, in short, the new few years are going to be full of exciting growth, and I can&#8217;t wait to see who I become.</p>
