<p>Hello friends, Happy Monday! This will be my last post for a few weeks &#8211; for those who don&#8217;t know, I will be traveling to join an archaeological excavation, and will have limited/no access to wifi.</p>



<p>I finally finished packing for my trip yesterday, and today I&#8217;ve been packing for my eventual move to grad school. My goodness, I have a lot of stuff! Books lining my shelves, tucked underneath my lamp, balanced on chairs, and even hidden inside my closet. Memorabilia from movies, plays, musicals, and museums. Thank you notes from when I used to volunteer with little kids. Birthday cards, homework, half-used diaries &#8211; honestly, I always considered myself a minimalist, but this cleanse was a healthy dose of reality.</p>



<p>My upcoming trip isn&#8217;t my first time out of the country by myself, but it does sort of mark my &#8216;true&#8217; passage to adulthood, if that makes sense. I applied and got accepted to this program by myself, I paid for it by myself, and I didn&#8217;t ask permission to go. It&#8217;s weird, going through my old things from just a few years ago and seeing how far I&#8217;ve come. Sixteen-year-old me was still stressing about AP Exams and if I would ever fall in love, and now, 20-year-old me is preparing to pay bills and travel the world.</p>



<p>When I was young, all I could think about was the future. I was SO EXCITED to finally start &#8216;living my life&#8217;. But, looking back, I <strong>was</strong> living &#8211; having fun with friends, being a part of my community, and preparing myself for a life of academics. Now, I&#8217;m just enjoying the present &#8211; I&#8217;m not particularly worried about this trip, and I&#8217;m not stressed about making a good impression or being the class favourite. Whatever happens will happen, and my goal is simply to make the best of every day I can. </p>



<p>I&#8217;ll see you guys in four weeks! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Hello, friends, happy Monday! I&#8217;ve been having a busy last few days, filled with hanging out with family, friends, and strangers. At one point last week, I had someone comment on my life, which, if you go by the highlights, has been extremely exciting and, as she put it, &#8220;like an adventure novel&#8221;. </p>



<p>To be honest, I was both flattered and bemused. I have always wanted to live a life of interest, filled with travels, hilarious escapades, and good friends. And now, in a lot of ways, I am fulfilling that dream, and I&#8217;m grateful.</p>



<p>Still, this wasn&#8217;t entirely the work of destiny. I made specific, life-altering decisions (such as studying abroad and going to grad school), and I continue to make daily choices (to work out, to text my long-distance friends, to study languages, etc.) that help shape my life into the way I want it to be.</p>



<p>Life is simultaneously long and short. I am a firm believer that a person can have it &#8216;all&#8217;, but not necessarily all at the same time. Now that I&#8217;m in my twenties, my priority for the next decade is to further my education, travel as much as possible, and be &#8216;selfish&#8217;, in a way, with how I spend my time. Of course there are practical concerns, such as money and family responsibilities and taxes and so on, but at the end of the day, you are in control of your life. I hope you live an adventure you&#8217;re proud of, and, if not, I hope you have the courage to start where you are now, and do what you can to chase your happiness.</p>

<p>Hello friends, happy Sunday! I have my last undergrad final EVER this Tuesday, and then next Tuesday I graduate!! Also, I just turned 20 a few days ago. SO, it makes sense that I&#8217;ve been feeling very nostalgic lately, and, in particular, I&#8217;ve been really thinking about how I&#8217;ve changed as a human being.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s so strange, trying to balance self-love with honest self-discipline. I love myself, but I am fundamentally imperfect, and it&#8217;s a good thing to want to work on that. </p>



<p>Growing up, I was a crazy, cheerful kid who cut my dresses with scissors and made friends with the school custodians. When I entered middle and high school, I got a bit more subdued, as I learned that people aren&#8217;t always kind, and I also went through my brief teenage rebellion (lol). In my first semester of college, I went through both romantic and platonic heartbreak, and it took me another entire semester to recover from that sadness.</p>



<p>So, this past year has been my chance to really LIVE for myself, without having to be dependent on my family or deal with emotional drama. This has also been my chance to really go crazy exploring the different facets of my personality, and figure out who I am when I&#8217;m surrounded by my peers who don&#8217;t know my past.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve changed so much. Some things might seem arbitrary, like how I now enjoy wearing jewelry and drinking iced mochas, while others are more obvious, such as my growing circle of friends and diminishing social anxiety. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s ok to change. It&#8217;s ok to redefine yourself, over and over again, as you grow up and gain new experiences. Sometimes I get scared that I&#8217;m &#8216;losing&#8217; myself to adulthood and social norms, but that fear is illogical. I am always going to be me, and if something makes me happy, it doesn&#8217;t matter if that thing is popular or a fringe interest.</p>



<p>My pursuit of happiness has remained the same, even as what makes me happy has evolved, and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s most important. </p>



<p>I wonder what the next years of my life will bring? I&#8217;m excited to find out <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Hello friends, happy Saturday! I&#8217;m uploading this blog post a little early, because this upcoming week I will be celebrating my birthday, writing my final essays, and also preparing for graduation. Last year, I made a post about 19 things I learned at 19, but now that I&#8217;m older and wiser (hehe) I think that I&#8217;ll share the skills I&#8217;m grateful to have right now. Thank you for all of your support, everyone, and have a wonderful week!</p>



<p>1. How to grocery shop</p>



<p>This took a bit a trial and error, but I learned how to actually grocery shop over the last few years, and it is a very useful skill, especially when your roommate buys six jars of Nutella and one bag of shredded cheese for the week&#8217;s meals&#8230;</p>



<p>2. How to be disciplined </p>



<p>You can&#8217;t just slap on a face mask and call it a day. You have to put on the face mask, knowing that you are taking time to relax, so that your productivity won&#8217;t be impacted by your stress levels. Procrastination is just fear of criticism and imperfection, so nix it asap and make time in your life for work and pleasure equally.</p>



<p>3. How to make friends</p>



<p>Friends are so, so important, I cannot stress this enough!!!! I used to label myself as an introvert, but in reality I&#8217;m an ambivert who was hanging out with the wrong group of people. Actively work to find your tribe, and show them you love them.</p>



<p>4. How to live with few regrets</p>



<p>“However, never underestimate the power of privately extending a simple, loving, but direct challenge. Though it may not be reciprocated, such love is never wasted.” &#8211; Elder Neal A. Maxwell. The common internet paraphrasing is &#8220;Love is never wasted, for its value does not rest on reciprocity&#8221;. Either way, very true!!</p>



<p>5. How to write a good thank you note</p>



<p>After interviews, when someone writes you a letter of recommendation, when your friend buys you a gift&#8230;I personally think that the art of handwritten thank you notes is very unappreciated in the modern world, and that should be remedied asap.</p>



<p>6. How to shop</p>



<p>It took me so long to admit I wear things that are too big because I&#8217;m uncomfortable with my body. However, not only was this a waste of money, but it was unflattering and further destroyed my confidence. IGNORE the label, and focus on how the actually fabric fits you. I&#8217;ve been everything from an XS to XL in the last few months, so just throw that all out of the window and look at your measurements.</p>



<p>7. How to play the piano</p>



<p>I think everyone should learn how to play at least one instrument, and even though I really hated being forced to learn when I was a kid, I&#8217;m grateful that I have a creative outlet that involves music.</p>



<p>8. How to accept a compliment</p>



<p>This is a bit harsh, but I&#8217;ll be honest &#8211; when I give someone a compliment and they turn it into an insult on themselves, it annoys me. I&#8217;m known as a person with good taste, so if I compliment your intellect or fashion sense, and you tell me I&#8217;m crazy, then we&#8217;re both in an awkward situation.</p>



<p>9. How to file taxes</p>



<p>I&#8217;m so, so grateful I forced myself to learn this early on my life, instead of paying someone half of my paycheck every year to do it for me.</p>



<p>10. How to forgive</p>



<p>Oof &#8211; sometimes people are cruel and ignorant. But, as an old Tumblr post once said, &#8220;The fire that warms your heart now will leave you cold in the grave&#8221;. Fight for justice, of course, but don&#8217;t let your mind be consumed with anger and resentment.</p>



<p>11. How to cook</p>



<p>Another!! Very!! Important!! Skill!! Please don&#8217;t be that twenty-something spending $100 a week on food because you don&#8217;t know how to boil an egg.</p>



<p>12. How to change a lightbulb</p>



<p>Another very useful and underrated skill!</p>



<p>13. How to tip</p>



<p>I always tip 20%~ by moving the decimal place and then multiplying the new number by 2. For example, if I have a bill of $16.43, I multiple $1.64 by 2 and then tip $3.24. Saves a lot of time!</p>



<p>14. How to use Microsoft, Excel, and Photoshop</p>



<p>I will enroll my children in computer coding classes, but until then, I&#8217;m glad I know how to use Microsoft, Excel, Photoshop, and I have basic video editing skills. The modern-day job market requires so much internet savvy, so do yourself a favor and learn early on.</p>



<p>15. How to apologize</p>



<p>It&#8217;s always hard to apologize, but it&#8217;s invaluable to your self growth, the person you are apologizing to, and also your relationship. I&#8217;ve screwed up countless times, but a heartfelt apology goes a long way, and my relationships have been made stronger by it.</p>



<p>16. How to cut a mango</p>



<p>I&#8217;m really good at this, lol.</p>



<p>17. How to study</p>



<p>Everyone learns differently, and I&#8217;ve realized that I study best when I&#8217;m alone in a cafe or similar environment with minimal noise and relaxed food policies. I&#8217;m also a hardcore handwritten-notes advocate. So, find out what works for you, and ACTUALLY do that.</p>



<p>18. How to take risks</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a difference between being stupid and taking a calculated risk. If you weigh the pros and cons, and the benefits are great, then stop thinking and go for it. Don&#8217;t, however, be reckless with your life and the lives of others.</p>



<p>19. How to draw quickly</p>



<p>The amount of times I&#8217;ve placated a small child with a drawing is immeasurable. Learn how to draw some basic animals, people, and rockets and you&#8217;ll be good. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>20. How to be grateful</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve loved my 19th year of life &#8211; I made so many new, genuine friends, and I&#8217;m so happy with what I&#8217;ve accomplished and what the future has in store for me. Shout-out to the universe for gifting me with this life, and here&#8217;s to hoping that 20 has even better adventures in store <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/ctb.ku.edu/sites/default/files/chapter_files/beingcompassionate.jpg?resize=338%2C252" alt="Image result for compassion" data-recalc-dims="1" /><figcaption><em>“Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them, humanity cannot survive.” </em><br> ― Dalai Lama XIV, The Art of Happiness</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Hello friends, happy Sunday! And, for those of you who are Christian, happy Easter!</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a bit sad right now &#8211; I woke up to the news of bombings in Sri Lankan churches, with hundreds of people dying and in pain. This is right after the news of the fire at Notre Dame, which, although the result of an accident, has still had a horrible effect on Easter celebrations.</p>



<p>A few hours after Notre Dame, my social media already began filling with people who were laughing about what had happened, saying it was &#8216;fate&#8217; for what Christian crusaders have done throughout the centuries, calling out the millionaires who were willing to pledge money to rebuild the church but not to help the homeless, and so on.</p>



<p>TBH, I find this a bit ironic. In the novel, <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>, by Victor Hugo, there is a LOT of social commentary about elitism, morality, compassion, etc. But, at the same time, Victor Hugo wrote the book because he wanted to SAVE Notre Dame from demolition &#8211; he thought it was an important symbol of Christianity, and an overall beautiful, historic building.</p>



<p>Now, people have used Christianity to excuse a LOT of truly evil, heinous acts. That is a fact. But, at the same time, you can twist ANY religious or spiritual belief into something that it&#8217;s not &#8211; just look at the recent bombing in Sri Lankan, which was carried out by Muslim terrorists. Islam is not an evil religion, but sometimes people who proclaim to be Muslim commit atrocities. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s not right to make fun of people&#8217;s suffering. Those who immediately ridiculed Notre Dame&#8217;s destruction should be ashamed of themselves, and those who chose to murder people in their place of worship, on a day of celebration, must answer for their crimes.</p>



<p>Sometimes, I wonder if religion is worth all of this pain. I live in a very liberal city, where my friends say that they aren&#8217;t religious because they don&#8217;t think religion is a good thing. A lot of people echo these sentiments.</p>



<p>However, I would disagree. My religion has shaped my moral compass, and has taught me right from wrong. It comforts me in times of distress. My religion has taught me that justice is worth fighting for, and forgiveness is the only way to let go of the past. I&#8217;m not trying to be a good person so that I can enjoy the afterlife &#8211; I&#8217;m trying to be a good person because I think that our sincere connections with others are the most important thing on Earth. </p>



<p>In this modern world, compassion is more important than ever. Regardless of your spiritual/religious beliefs, I hope we can treat each other gently, so that we can live together in peace. </p>

I&#8217;m writing this post a day early, because I have a busy week ahead, but I still want to keep in touch with y&#8217;all <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Yesterday, I had a really good day. I got to spend time with someone I love (I suppose you could call her a &#8216;best friend&#8217;, but she&#8217;s more than that, because I know I&#8217;ll love her forever) and we had a lot of fun eating, catching up, and exercising.</p>
</div></div>



<p>In the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve really been thinking about how I want my next two years in grad school to look like. I don&#8217;t want to keep ignoring my health in the way I have during undergrad. I don&#8217;t want to keep denying myself the small pleasures of life, like fresh flowers or cute jewelry, just for the sake of &#8216;being practical&#8217;. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and you are responsible for your own happiness.</p>



<p>SO, this fall, I&#8217;m going to start becoming really serious about working out. I do work out now, but I don&#8217;t have easy access to healthy food, so I only have to energy to do cardio. This fall, I want to start growing my muscles and building my strength. </p>



<p>I also think that I&#8217;m going to invest in a Vitamix. I&#8217;ve wanted one for a looonnnggg time, and I&#8217;m excited to make smoothies, hummus, pesto, etc., from scratch. I&#8217;m planning on cooking most of my meals at home, but one of my big loves in life is food, and I don&#8217;t want to sacrifice that.</p>



<p>Finally, I want to invest in myself. Things like seriously studying French (I&#8217;m hoping to take a proficiency exam in two years), finding my own sense of style, decorating my new apartment, etc., are goals that will take a bit of money and a lot of time, but I will reap the benefits, and it will make me happy.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m thinking for the future, and I know that I&#8217;m rambling, but, in short, the new few years are going to be full of exciting growth, and I can&#8217;t wait to see who I become.</p>

<p>Happy Monday, everyone! I admit, I haven&#8217;t been having a very good past few days, but the nice thing about growing up is that you learn how to manage your emotions. So, even though things have happened, I&#8217;m doing alright <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Anyways, I wanted to talk today about the benefits and problems of one of my go-to comfort activities as a kid &#8211; taking personality tests. I always liked them because you get the suspense of &#8216;results&#8217; without the stress of academia. Today, though, scrolling through MBTI and Buzzfeed didn&#8217;t give me the thrill that it once did.</p>
<p>It seems silly, but I genuinely enjoyed taking these quizzes. I liked having someone explain why I am the way I am, because it meant that I could be understood, and that I wasn&#8217;t a freakish anomaly. It also helped that the results were usually very complimentary &#8211; my pre-pubescent self loved hearing how &#8216;brave like a lion&#8217; I was, or how my favourite ice cream flavor showed I was  &#8216;unusual but elegant&#8217;.</p>
<p>In particular, I have always tested as INFJ-A through the MBTI test, which was the go-to personality exam at both my high school and my current university. It means that I rely on intuition and emotion before making assertive judgments &#8211; according to many websites, INFJs are the rarest type of personality in the world. When I was in middle school and high school, trying to navigate social dynamics, I found solace in the idea that I wasn&#8217;t fitting in because &#8216;I&#8217;m rare and unusual&#8217; &#8211; rather than the harsher possibility that I wasn&#8217;t fitting in because something was wrong with me.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I look back on personality tests with a fond wariness. I had a lot of fun learning what kind of dragon I would be, or what profession I should pursue. But, in hindsight, it seems a bit self-indulgent.I think the problem with these personality tests is that<strong> they will never be able to fully grasp the complexity that every person has inside them </strong>&#8211; people are not always smart, they are not always altruistic, and everything is tinged with grey. Another problem I have with them is that<strong> they give you one, unchanging definition &#8211; you are this and that&#8217;s that. </strong>But one of the greatest things about life is that there is always room for change.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I used to be a compulsive people-pleaser. I HATED having people mad at me, or even slightly annoyed. According to MBTI, that&#8217;s a classic INFJ trait, and something that is a dominant part of my personality. But now, at 19 (almost 20) years old, I really don&#8217;t think that definition fits me anymore. Yes, I do still struggle with conflict, and I try my best to avoid tense environments. But, I have based my life choices on what I was to do in life, as opposed to what others want of me &#8211; I am happily dancing to the beat of my own drum right now, and I don&#8217;t think any personality quiz could account for my own, unique individuality.</p>

<p>Hello, loves! During weeks like this, when I&#8217;m grinding hard and hustling every hour of every day, it&#8217;s really easy to burn myself out. Burn out is an awful feeling when you lose your passion, drive, and motivation after overexerting yourself mentally and physically. I haven&#8217;t burnt out yet, and I&#8217;d like to keep it that way &#8211; so, below is my self care ritual that I try to implement every week day. Let me know if you try it out, and happy Monday, everyone!</p>
<h3>1. Change into comfy clothes</h3>
<p>As soon as I get back from work/school/lab/commitments, I change into my comfiest clothes, usually an oversized t-shirt and sweatpants. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but staying in my &#8216;going-out&#8217; clothes keeps me perpetually on alert, as if I have to be ready to walk out at any second.</p>
<h3>2. Eat/Drink something</h3>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been very good about this (one of the cons of living in a tiny dorm room with no kitchen), but I TRY to at least drink some water as soon as I get back, and I like to eat a small snack. When I was living in my own apartment in London, I really enjoyed some tea with a Digestive cookie.</p>
<h3>3. Put on some tunes</h3>
<p>I LOVE music, but unfortunately I can&#8217;t concentrate on work, or properly study, when I&#8217;m jamming out to my playlist, and so the only time I get to listen to music is when I&#8217;m relaxing. Right now, I&#8217;m re-listening to Queen, as well as enjoying Ariana Grande&#8217;s new album.</p>
<h3>4. Open the window</h3>
<p>Fresh! Air! Is! So! Important! Seriously, especially if you&#8217;ve been cramped up in a cubicle or stuck behind a desk all day, then some fresh air will make a world of difference to your mood. Try it!</p>
<h3>5. Rot my brain</h3>
<p>And by this, I mean watching makeup tutorials on Youtube, scrolling through Instagram, and taking Buzzfeed quizzes. Basically, I perform all my guilty pleasures for about 20 minutes, and I do so with absolutely no guilt at all.</p>
<p>And then, by the end of this routine, I&#8217;m ready to eat some dinner and get to work on everything else I have to do that day!</p>

<p>Hey kids! Currently recovering from food poisoning (yes, right after I just recovered from my cold), but I honestly couldn&#8217;t be happier! I received a lot of really, really good news this past week, and my future is looking positively exhilarating right now.</p>
<p>Life is going by so quickly, and a part of me wonders if I should feel nervous or frightened. In truth, though, I&#8217;m too happy to let anxiety into my headspace. My life isn&#8217;t anything how I imagined it would be &#8211; as a kid, I saw the traditional path that my friends and family went on, and I automatically assumed that I would head down it as well. Go to university for four years, get a job that pays the bills, get married, and have kids. Simple, proven-to-work, and easy, right?</p>
<p>Right now, though, I&#8217;m about to turn twenty in a few months, I&#8217;m set to visit two countries before the year ends, and I&#8217;m going to be moving out-of-state for a graduate school program that&#8217;s insanely cool and involves scuba diving for sunken treasure. After that, I&#8217;m probably going to do another masters program, or get a PhD, and I&#8217;m definitely traveling even more. I&#8217;m literally paving my own path that no one else has ever gone down. My whole childhood, people told me that I couldn&#8217;t do this, or I wasn&#8217;t capable of doing that. It wasn&#8217;t always malicious, either &#8211; a lot of their warnings came from a place of love. Even now, at a top university where history is made every day, I&#8217;ve had professors and peers try to &#8216;bring me back to reality&#8217;. But, I&#8217;ve now grown up enough that I can acknowledge their worries without letting them dictate my choices, and I&#8217;m proud that I&#8217;ve reached the point in my life where I can confidently go in the direction of my dreams.</p>
<p>You are the only person who knows what you are capable of &#8211; not your teachers, not your friends, and not even your parents. If you have a gut feeling that you can accomplish something, then you have to chase after that goal, even if that means surpassing people&#8217;s expectations. If you let others define you, then you limit your life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that I&#8217;ve got this &#8216;life&#8217; thing figured out completely &#8211; I&#8217;m still a teenager, after all. But I do think that I&#8217;m developing a secure confidence in my abilities and choices, and I hope to carry that self-assuredness throughout all of my upcoming adventures.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, everyone! It is a rainy and dreary start to February, and I have finally caught the cold that&#8217;s been going around campus these last few weeks.

<p>Hello, everyone! It is a rainy and dreary start to February, and I have finally caught the cold that&#8217;s been going around campus these last few weeks. Just to clarify, I really, REALLY hate being sick &#8211; I&#8217;d rather have to pull an all-nighter, eat mushrooms for every meal, or even get my heart broken. Literally anything is better than the horrible feeling of your body betraying you and letting those germs into your system.</p>
<p>But, I&#8217;m trying to make the best of things, and I&#8217;m not in a bad mood &#8211; I got accepted into a graduate program, it&#8217;s Chinese New Year, and I called my parents yesterday, so life is pretty good right now. Still, I want to get better ASAP, and so below are things I&#8217;m doing to try and get myself back to feeling 100%. Let me know in the comments below what your sick day routine is, and stay healthy, folks!</p>
<h3>1. Sleep at least 10+ hours</h3>
<p>This has been a bit hard to do, since I have a roommate in a tiny dorm room, but I&#8217;ve been trying to sleep at least 10+ hours every night to give my body time to recover. Make sure that it&#8217;s proper sleep though, with all technology turned off, and a warm bed.</p>
<h3>2. Keep yourself warm</h3>
<p>Speaking of a warm bed, keep yourself wrapped up at all times. Especially if it&#8217;s cold where you live, you need to be dressing in layers to try and sweat out the toxins. Personally, I&#8217;ve been wearing two layers of pants, socks, and shirts, in addition to my coat and scarf. In addition, make sure that your eating a lot of warm foods, like soup or porridge- now is not the time for ice cream!</p>
<h3>3. Drink healthy beverages</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a ginger and lemon tea every hour, and I&#8217;ve had a green antioxidant smoothie every day I&#8217;ve been feeling under the weather. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s a placebo, but I do feel much better when my drinks contribute to my nutrient intake.</p>
